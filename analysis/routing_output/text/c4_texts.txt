This object indicates the numerically lowest available index within this entity, which may be used for the value of etsysConfigMgmtChangeIndex in the creation of a new entry in the etsysConfigMgmtChangeTable. An index is considered available if the index value falls within the range of 1 to etsysConfigMgmtChangeLimit and is not being used to index an existing entry in the etsysConfigMgmtChangeTable contained within this entity. A value of zero indicates that all of the entries in the etsysConfigMgmtChangeTable are currently in use.

When the value of this object is 'active' none of the other objects in this conceptual row can be modified. Setting this object to the 'active' state from the 'notInService' state will cause the requested configuration operation to be initiated. Once the requested configuration operation has completed, successfully or otherwise, this leaf will be set to the 'notInService' state by the managed entity. Setting this object to any other valid state from the 'active' state SHOULD cause the managed entity to cancel the requested operation at its earliest most rational opportunity. Setting this object to the 'active' state from the 'active' state SHOULD NOT have any affect. Conceptual rows that have been in the 'notInService' state for more than a device specific time period MAY be destroyed by the managed entity.

It seems like over the coarse of a weekend, Central Park went from fresh, green leaves to brilliant shades of fiery red and golden ombres. With candy corn and pumpkin pies now being old news (but so yummy), November is well and truly off and running.
Saks has already adorned their first floor with their trademark garland, sparking the urge for peppermint lattes and window gazing. Knowing the big apple typically becomes an ice block in December/January, I relish this time of year, when layering can actually be cute and walks in Central Park are paved with golden leaves vs. mounds of snow.

James Newitt‚Äôs exhibition is fragmented, divided into parts evoking concepts and metaphors of Heterotopias and of Plato‚Äôs Cave. Moving and still images ‚Äì a video installation and photographs ‚Äì are combined with texts and drawings in the form of a screenplay and a series of ‚Äòmindmaps‚Äô, presented inside and on the glass fa√ßade of the space. The light from the videos merges with diluted daylight, an effect created by covering the gallery‚Äôs windows with a reflective film. The video which, is projected on both sides of a suspended screen, depicts two young boxers training alone in front of a mirror. The young men only confront each other in an imagined space. The movement of the camera as it films, circling the protagonist, anticipates the movement of viewers around the screen ‚Äì which produces further reflections in the windows of the gallery space. The viewer positions themselves physically and mentally within the range of heterotopias of a boxing club and an art space, both occurring on the frayed edges of their areas of action and their common location in the outskirts of Lisbon. The reflections of bodies in the impossible ‚Äòthere‚Äô of the reflected image in the mirror merging with the ‚Äòreal‚Äô image of the Alta de Lisboa landscape which exists just beyond the frame.
I resisted buying a cell phone. The car was one of my last refuges from people.
I bought one, and moved to a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone soon after.
Now I have to decide when to leave it in the truck when I get home so I won‚Äôt answer it. I leave it in the charger so that the battery will last when I go to bed at night. It is no different from when I was a student. If I chose a table in the main part of the library to study, I knew I was open to socializing. It was the code. I have spend plenty of non-productive hours in the library.
I then learned to find great hiding places where I worked when I chose to focus, and amazing things followed. The only difference is that the ‚Äúpreserve‚Äù around solitude used to be much greater, if that makes sense. With a phone in your pocket, bike pack, back pack or purse, the ‚Äúpreserve‚Äù is as small as your personal interaction zone. Small.
WITH that I have noticed an image coming in through sci-fi and other sources: the hive or interconnected mentality where one participates in the inmost thoughts of thousands. It was in the Borg in Star Trek, it will come again in Card‚Äôs vision for the enemy in Ender‚Äôs Game.
Think about it. We have this desire (many of us) to share intimacy, to share ourselves with others (Facebook, Pinterest, all the new sites) and we think it may be possible somewhere out there.
Christians found something as close as humanly possible in the beginning of Christianity and coined a word for it ‚Äî koinonia ‚Äî the concept of fellowship that is intimate and powerful.
So how do you balance the two? The thirst for some solitude and some sense of belonging to others and possibly to something big? I don‚Äôt know a lot, but I know that both take work. Both demand time.
Both are worth it. And my saying that may be an almost unconscionable grace. I am grateful if it is.
The Marines are apologizing for a well-intentioned Christmas gift gone wrong that has upset the families of about 1,150 fallen Marines and sailors who received a Purple Heart Christmas tree ornament in the mail addressed to their deceased loved one.
Late last week the Marine's Wounded Warrior Regiment mailed about 9,000 Christmas ornaments donated by the Semper Fi Fund, a charitable organization. The ornaments were intended for post 9/11 living Marine recipients of the Purple Heart, which is the award given to service members wounded in combat. Sailors awarded the Purple Heart while attached to or serving in support of Marine Corps units were to also receive the brass ornaments that contain an image of the Purple Heart in the center.
However, the regiment's list of Purple Heart recipients did not distinguish between the names of living and deceased recipients of the medal. That meant about 1,150 families of fallen Marines and sailors also received the ornament in packages addressed to their deceased loved one.
The regiment apologized to the families today after it began to receive calls Monday night from family members distressed about how the packages had been addressed.
"There are no words to express how very sorry we are for the hurt such a mistake has caused the families of our fallen warriors," Col. John L. Mayer, the regiment's commanding officer, said in a statement. "We always strive to honor the sacrifices these Marines, sailors and their families gave to this country.
"There is no excuse for why this happened," he said. "We accept full responsibility for this error and are moving quickly to reach out to the families we have affected."
"The intention was to thank Purple Heart recipients for their service," said Capt. Jill Wolf, a spokeswoman for the Wounded Warrior Regiment, which assists non-medical care to injured Marines, sailors and their families as they return to duty or transition to civilian life.
The regiment is sending letters of apology to the families of fallen Marines and sailors included in the mailing and Mayer is personally calling the families who contacted the regiment.
Wolf said that the Marine Corps began to receive calls from the families of fallen Marines on Monday as the packages began to arrive in the mail. By this evening, 35 families had contacted the Marines, with the majority expressing shock that the packages had been addressed to their loved ones and asking to be removed from the list.
She said there had also been some positive feedback from some families who wanted the Marines to know how much the ornament had meant to them, but who also asked to be removed from the list.

This Kendogi is 100% Cotton, dark navy blue.
The shoulder has a reinforcement that will protect from rubbing with the Do Himo.
Nice set, I bought for a Kid and, for training, that set is satisfactory.
I'm happy with the quality of the product and the customer service I received when ordering. The nice people at e-bogu were helpful with finding the right fit (I'm a large person) and making sure that the embroidery was correct. Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase.
UPDATE: I've used this uniform for over six years now. It's been pretty well abused during that time, but it's hanging in there just fine. The colour doesn't fade in the same way as a shoaizome dyed uniform. The hakama have turned a fairly even medium blue, while the gi has faded more unevenly, and with an almost purple tint in the most faded areas. The fabric has held together nicely, with no worn out areas or tears, and the little strings for tying it closed are still intact. The areas where the dou himo cross over my shoulders has not worn out like I've seen on other gi of comparable age. It is functional and durable in its old age, if not as pretty as a traditionally dyed set.
Great attention and great quality product!
Fast shipping, and great quality product!
Keikogi quite suitable for the hot Caribbean climate. Decent quality for the price.

So. It‚Äôs quiet around here. The Girl and her Dad-O took off for cooler temperatures and more entertaining people last week, leaving me with a wide open schedule to take this test prep by the horns. I finished the Doctors in Training Step 1 review course (15 days, 3 lectures per day) and am reading and doing questions most of the day now. This morning my friend and I did a dry run to the testing center; we even did some reconnaissance regarding temperature and lockers inside. I‚Äôm not ready to take the test yet, but I have a week to review and plane tickets for the next morning, so there‚Äôs no turning back now!
Have you ever spent a week away from your child? Because I hadn‚Äôt. I think the longest we‚Äôve been apart approached 5 days once, until this time. The first couple of days I did a lot of milling around and not sleeping ‚Äì put it on my tab ‚Äì but was able to put about half of those extra hours toward studying. They return tomorrow, thank goodness. Every Mom yearns for alone time and lots of space to stretch out and be comfortable and do whatever she pleases. Did I appreciate the opportunity? Yes, and I‚Äôve been productive. But I‚Äôve grown accustomed to their faces and am disoriented without them here.
In their absence, Chief has stepped up been here to receive my extra love and ramblings. (BTW, I still can‚Äôt believe this happened.) We‚Äôve gone on long walks with Goljan audio and frequented the dog park. New landscaping has meant water runoff into the dog park, creating fantastic mud pits for wallowing. So we‚Äôve had a few baths. Confirming Joel‚Äôs suspicions that his main objective in life is to be in everyone‚Äôs way, he has avoided the bed for all but a few hours the whole week. Without Joel‚Äôs long frame to impede, what point would there be?
Enough of my lonesome musings and avoidance of First Aid. I gotta make today count!
good luck! hope you are well!

FORT BRAGG, N.C. ‚Äî Bowe Bergdahl, the Army sergeant who walked off his post in Afghanistan and triggered a search that wounded some of his comrades, will serve no prison time, a military judge ruled Friday at the end of the politically divisive case that stirred debate during the president campaign.
The charges centered on a decision by one soldier that affected many other lives. Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban and held for five years, until President Barack Obama traded Taliban prisoners to bring him back. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump called for Bergdahl to face stiff punishment. He could have received up to life in prison.
The judge also gave Bergdahl a dishonorable discharge, reduced his rank to private and ordered him to forfeit pay equal to $1,000 per month for 10 months. The judge made no other comments.
The defense sought to counter that evidence with testimony about Bergdahl's suffering as a captive, his contributions to military intelligence and survival training and his mental health problems. The argument for leniency also cited harsh campaign-trail criticism by Trump.
The White House said it had no comment on the sentence and referred back to a statement from several weeks ago that said Trump expects everyone in the military justice system "to exercise their independent professional judgment, consistent with applicable laws and regulations."
A punitive discharge deprives Bergdahl of most or all his veterans' benefits.
Capt. Nina Banks, a defense attorney, said it would not be justice to rescue Bergdahl from the Taliban "only to place him in a cell" now.
Bergdahl "does not have a monopoly on suffering as a result of his choices," Maj. Justin Oshana said.
At the time of Bergdahl's release, Obama said the U.S. does not leave its service members on the battlefield. Republicans roundly criticized Obama, and Trump went further while campaigning for president, repeatedly calling Bergdahl a traitor who deserved serious punishment.

At first glance, Fukuoka seems like a peaceful city, but under the surface, crime is running rampant. The cityÔøΩs Hakata ward is home to the professionals of the underworld: professional killers, detectives, informants, professional revenge seekers, those skilled in torture, and more. And according to urban legend, even a killer of professional killers exists in the city. When stories of the men in the underworld are told, a professional killer murder appears.
Some business trends are long-lasting and withstand changing attitudes and the tests of time. Others are fleeting and quickly replaced by the next fad to catch headlines. However, one business trend that‚Äôs not going away anytime soon is the impact of technology and culture.
Company culture is important to the success of any company and its employees. In a survey of global CEOs, culture was named one of the top five factors affecting long-term company value. When technology and culture intersect, companies experience a range of benefits, from improved employee engagement and productivity to enhanced career development opportunities.
Company culture is more than a dress code or tradition of celebrating coworkers‚Äô birthdays. It encompasses the entire mission and values of the organization, as well as the aggregate of employee attitudes and behaviors.
In the digital age, technology has transformed workplaces around the globe. Collaboration tools bring remote teams closer together on projects, and big data and AI have elevated business activities like employee recruitment and client engagement.
Technology helps promote company culture by improving employee productivity and making jobs easier. For example, a sales manager with a powerful CRM no longer has to spend time poring over manual sales records. Instead, the manager can use that time to connect and build relationships with direct reports and clients. When the manager has more time to make connections with others, a culture based on mutual respect, trust, and teamwork has the opportunity to thrive.
Technology also improves communication between employees, which helps promote a culture of collaboration and inclusion. Social messaging tools, video conferences, and company chat platforms allow individuals and teams to share ideas and solve problems together, instead of allowing silos to form.
Make it relevant: Select technology solutions that are relevant and help employees work smarter. Implementing a tech solution that isn‚Äôt the best fit for your organization may actually cause employees to become less productive and engaged.
Reward employees who support the culture: Consider employee development tools like gamified reward systems or performance feedback platforms that provide healthy incentives for employees to support the culture. Two-way feedback tools not only engage employees but also let them have a say in how the culture evolves.
Bring the culture alive: Live org charts help employees see and understand company culture by helping them put a name to a face and see exactly where their role fits within the larger context of the organization.
When combined, technology and culture can ignite employee productivity and engagement, transforming how individuals execute and collaborate in the workplace. Every organization is different, thus some tech tools may be more relevant than others. However, no matter your company‚Äôs size or industry, the powerful mix of technology and culture can revolutionize internal processes and systems, and breathe new life into your organization.

Beard is the collection of hair around the cheeks and chin. A well groomed beard can be a sign of well being as it can be a sign of high self esteem or ego to some people. One thing you need to know is everyone can grow the beard but many people consider it as a sign of unprofessionalism in certain careers or professions but that is not the case because a beard cannot hinder you from working no matter how long and how groomed the beard really is. Growing a beard sometimes requires a lot of commitment and one must have what it takes and be willing to grow it.
-Why should one grow a beard?
One can grow a beard for very many reasons, one of the most reasons men grow a beard for is to look more attractive to potential partners. A well groomed beard can also make one look very masculine and even in the event of a competition one who has a beard is considered to have a competitive edge in some places. Also some men grow beards to raise money for cancer and this is one way that a beard can help you reach out to the society.
Now let us talk about how you can grow a beard. Growing the beard of your choice will require commitment that is one thing you should be willing to do. Leave the beard alone after you take on growing it. Do not shave for at least three weeks or four, this will help the beard grow long enough o get to the point of trimming it so do not start shaving because it might be too soon. To many people shaving a beard is normal while growing the beard is an exception but when you want to grow the beard, the vice versa mostly applies.
Be patient and leave the beard alone to grow. Do not start trimming too early just because you are anxious to see how it will come out as. Instead be patient and let it grow to a length that will be easier to trim and if you just happen to over trim it do not give up at least not yet give it another chance and another if need be.
After growing the beard that is not the end of it all, you should maintain it well by trimming it to the length you want and cleaning it regularly. Use a beard trimmer to trim your beard and also wash it using shampoo mostly the one you use to wash you head with is recommended. Dry your beard well with a towel after cleaning it and if possible you can even blow dry it. Though it is not a must you blow dry it you can do it at least once in a month or so but you can also do it daily if you like.

Home ¬ª Our Team ¬ª What is An Oncologist?
Oncologists are specialist doctors who focus on the non-surgical management of cancer. Generally, Oncologists are either trained in Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy or Both methods of cancer treatment.
In Singapore‚Äôs context, internal medicine physicians who wish to pursue a career in medical oncology continue with on-the-job specialist training to become ‚Äòmedical oncology‚Äô specialists who focus on using chemotherapy to treat cancer patients. They do not provide radiation treatments for their patients. This is why unlike their American board-certified colleagues, medical oncologists from Singapore hold the MRCP qualification just like other internal medicine specialists.
Training for radiotherapy is undertaken via 2 tracks, namely the Australian or the British system. The Australian system focuses only on radiotherapy and after obtaining qualifications and training in radiation oncology, candidates become ‚Äòradiation oncology‚Äô specialists. The British system is a comprehensive qualification in Clinical Oncology called ‚ÄòFRCR in Clinical Oncology‚Äô requiring training and competency in both Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy. Upon obtaining the FRCR in Clinical Oncology qualification and satisfying training requirements in Singapore, candidates become ‚Äòradiation oncology‚Äô specialists.
In summary, there are 2 types of Oncology specialists recognized by the Specialist Accreditation Board in Singapore, namely the medical oncologist and the radiation oncologist. The medical oncologist is trained only in chemotherapy and does not provide radiotherapy for their patients. All radiation oncologists are specialists who are at the minimum trained in radiotherapy, while those with the Clinical Oncology qualification are dual trained in chemotherapy as well.
In this era of rapid advancement, a broad-based education coupled with a sub-specialised team approach is the only way cancer patients can receive the most updated treatments for their condition.
It was a rainy day when two crazy creative minds met by chance. The immediate empathy led them to collaborate on different projects, creating a strong successful understanding and, above all, the desire to undertake an independent path together.
And that‚Äôs how Momo Made in Brain was born: thanks to the creativity, the skills and the will of two ‚Äústubborn‚Äù heads, "Ginger and Pummy".
The bags under her eyes due to lack of sleep, her unruly hair, impertinent irony and incessant curiosity represent those distinctive traits that, combined with the countless cups of coffee and chocolate bars she consumes, have, for years now, supported her passion for writing, communication and her sweet tooth. She is a contributing journalist, dedicating her free time to her private life and meeting new people sharing the same thirst for knowledge with the right dose of madness. She keeps herself well away from nature as its full of insects, she adores city life, shopping mall, cats and roller skates. She also loves surprises, only nice ones though.
Perplexed (and inquisitor) eyebrow, upside down hair but practical solutions to any problem. She decided to become a graphic designer at the age of 2 when, in front of her sketch she, Pummy, told her parents all the shades of color she used to made it. But behind the pre-announced talent there is also much study, creativity and ingenuity... supported by unlimited cups of bitter and hot coffee. He loves yellow, plays football and hates to travel (especially by public transport), but she rides always her vespa to defeat evil (graphic or not!) plans with his invisible superhero cloak. Because, in the end, big graphic powers come with great advertising responsibilities!
Graduated in Sociology and keen on movies (classical or not), she became the director of Scuola di Cinema di Napoli.

She has always been active in Communication and Cinema through festivals and big events.
Her contribution to this creative network is fundamental: shining smile, contagious optimism and, above all, many crazy ideas to share.

Consulting engineers are being confused by apparently conflicting requirements between local planning officers and the most recent changes to Part L of the Building Regulations, according to experts.
Although the carbon reduction targets set by the revised Part L (2013) are modest ‚Äì just 6 per cent for new homes and 9 per cent for commercial buildings ‚Äì they should improve insulation levels and this could reduce the effectiveness of renewables.
‚ÄúHigher insulation standards will reduce the need for heat, but renewables depend on heat demand to operate,‚Äù said David Shaw, LZC national sales manager for Baxi Commercial Division.
Mr Shaw believes this is driving designers to make perverse technology choices that may not be in the interests of the building owner or operator.
‚ÄúWe are seeing terrible mis-matches because designers are getting confused ‚Äì and even worse, they don‚Äôt always recognise the impact of making the wrong choices. It is important that designers make sure they are specifying an appropriate solution for the building and not just ticking boxes,‚Äù added Mr Shaw.
This article is pretty misleading. Where authorities have a renewable energy requirement, this is expressed as % (usually 10%) reduction (post implementation of Part L requirements). Hence, the 2013 Part L improvement reduces the remaining % reduction that must be achieved via renewables. And no local authority demands that the renewable system must be heat producing (why not PV?). In any case, many authorities have moved away from renewables requirements to a simple % CO2 reduction beyond Part L (whether achieved with or without renewables). The 2013 Part L requirements were watered down from the original proposals to reach the energy requirement for Code Level 4 - so still plenty of scope for CO2 reduction whether from renewables or not.

Gambling laws vary widely from one country to the next. Sometimes the laws about casinos, online gaming, bonus codes and other betting activities are dictated by the country's leaders. In other cases the decisions were made based on the majority's religious beliefs.
In any case, it's a good idea to know about a country's gambling laws before you plan a trip.
In the United States, gambling laws are set by the individual states. Most states operate a lottery but Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nevada and Utah do not have Powerballs or any other type of State Lottery.
For many decades, land-based casinos were only allowed to operate in Nevada; but over the last few decades, many other states have passed legislation that enables brick-and-mortar casinos to operate within their borders ‚Äì these include Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Colorado, Michigan, West Virginia, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, New York, Mississippi, Louisiana and Indiana.
Native American Tribes may run casinos in states that allow casino gambling without oversight of state regulators. Congress regulates Indian casinos which frees them from state laws and state supervision. Indian tribes may operate casinos only in states where casinos are allowed to operate.
A recent Supreme Court ruling has given states the opportunity to legislate sports betting. Until May 2018 only Delaware and Nevada were allowed to offer sports betting since they did so before anti-sports betting legislation was passed in the 1990s. With the Supreme Court ruling new states will be allowed to offer sports betting opportunities.
A part the State of New Jersey (here a list of sites authorized by the NJ Division of Gaming Enforcement), Online betting is still illegal in the United States under laws that control money-laundering that may pass through online banks to and from online casinos. Those laws may also be challenged in the near future.
Gambling in Canada is regulated by local provinces. Each province has its own Gaming Corporation which runs under the auspices of the province's Finance Ministry. These Gaming Corporations regulate the casinos, the lotteries and any other gambling activities, including charitable gambling, that occurs in the province.
The Interprovincial Lottery Corporation (ILC) operates Canadian lottery games. It is owned by the five provincial lottery commissions ‚Äì Ontario Lottery, Quebec Lottery, British Columbia Lottery, Atlantic Lottery (serving the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick) and the Western Canada Lottery (serving provinces of Manitoba, Alberta, Nunavut, Nortwest Territories and Yukon and Saskatchewan.
The ILC administers 4 games (Lotto 4/69, Lotto Max, Daily Grand and Celebration). Provincial Lottery Corporations market the national games as well as their own provincial games.
Online gambling in Canada is legal. Many of the provincial lottery Corporations offer their own online activities including options to buy lottery tickets online and options to play games online. Offshore casino gaming is legal in Canada. The Quebec provincial government is attempting to limit such offshore gambling activities in order to bolster its own Quebec Lottery but it has not been successful since doing so would violate the country's free Internet laws.
In the UK there are multiple gambling opportunities for people 18 and older including adult gaming centers, betting shops, brick-and-mortar casinos, bingo halls, racetracks and online gambling. There is also a National Lottery, lottery and football pools which are open to individuals aged 16 and older.
Many of the betting centers (the old corner bookies) have installed gaming machines such as slots, poker machines and roulette machines. These machines are very popular and provide the greater part of the shops' income, above and beyond the wagers that are placed on sports events and other types of bets.
Online gaming is growing in popularity in the UK. It's legal for offshore casinos to offer gaming options for UK residents and many of the large betting companies (such as William Hill and Ladbrokes) see this as cutting into the profits that they realize from their betting shops.
It's estimated that more than 80% of Australian adults engage in some type of gambling on a regular basis. Statisticians say that this represents the highest rate of gambling in the world. The Australian gambling laws are extremely liberal which makes it easy for Aussies to enjoy a wide range of casino gambling activities.
Land-based casinos, state and territory lotteries and racetrack gambling are regulated by the individual states and territories. The Interactive Gambling Act of 2001 outlawed offshore casinos from offering gambling activities to people located in Australia. Fines could be levied against the casinos but not the players so Australian citizens continue to play at these online casinos since the casinos continue to offer gaming options for Aussies.
The New Zealand Ministry of Health, via the Department of Internal Affairs, regulates gambling in conjunction with the Gambling Commission. These agencies are charged with ensuring that New Zealand gamers have access to safe, secure and fair online and land-based casino gaming. The agencies monitor brick-and-mortar casinos, racetrack betting, lotteries, sports betting and online casinos.
NZ gambling legislation is enforced by the NZ Department of Internal Affairs. The Ministry of Health funds and coordinates services for people with obsessive gambling behaviors. The Gambling Commission licenses land-based casinos.
The NZ government does not regulate "offshore" casinos. Kiwis have unlimited access to these freemarket casino sites.

Looking for a Maryland Wedding DJ ?
Bay Deejays is a Baltimore-based boutique-style entertainment firm that concentrates only on helping our clients plan and execute 100% perfect wedding ceremonies and receptions. When I started the company, I already had more than a decade of experience in the mobile DJ business and had already entertained at hundreds of weddings, corporate events, proms, mitzvahs, night clubs, and various other private parties doing business as Jason Walsh Entertainment.
While I enjoyed the variety of events I booked, it soon became clear that I was being referred by the area's leading venues, top wedding vendors, and most importantly - by my past clients, for my ability to pack a wedding reception dance floor from start to finish. Along with good friends and exclusive subcontractors, Chris Hart and Bob Sigmon, Bay Deejays took shape in 2009 and from our first year, we were recognized among the Top 5% of all DJs in the Baltimore Metro area by WeddingWire (a leading national wedding planning website and print magazine) - an award that Bay Deejays has proudly won every year since our inception.
Today, I'm honored that my Baltimore-based small business holds a perfect 100% client satisfaction rating on WeddingWire and The Knot and that Bay Deejays is recommended by top destination venues such as The Chesapeake Bay Beach Club and the Tidewater Inn.
Wedding planning doesn't have to be difficult... When my wife and I look back at our own planning journey - the one thing that was missing from many wedding vendors, unfortunately, was transparency. Upfront pricing, honesty, and good communications are something I valued as a wedding client, and these are things I promise to all of our couples. If you don't immediately feel like you "click" with any wedding vendor your interview, you should probably continue looking. If a vendor is hiding their pricing, they are likely trying to see how many "extras" they can sell you. I post my prices and proudly advertise that no, I am not the cheapest guy in town - but I do have a list of hundreds of satisfied clients that have told me and other wedding vendor review readers, "Bay Deejays was the overall best investment for our wedding!"
If you are looking to host a fun, but also classy, wedding reception and want a DJ and MC that will: entertain all of your guests, make energetic (but not cheesy) announcements and event transitions, and provide you with one-on-one planning guidance and best practices from over 1,000 successful weddings, I'd love to meet with you and your fiance/fiancee/partner.
The wheel is supposed to be the biggest invention of humankind. After its invention, new machines and vehicles were invented to reduce the distances between two places. The car is the most used personal mode of transportation in daily life and BMW is one of the biggest names in the auto industry.
BMW is renowned for its style, class, elegance and quality. Furthermore, BMW is also acknowledged for its innovation and comfort. BMW, as expected, has taken a step ahead in this modern world of technology by using the HERE Location Platform.
The HERE Location Platform works in quite an efficient way by allowing a navigating device be connected to the public internet sources in cities. The information gathered allows the system to update information being displayed in real time. The information can collaborate with other drivers for better results in traffic information. Eventually, autonomous driving will depend on this type of this real-time data source.
A driver can use HERE location platform for various purposes. First, this system can be integrated with the GPS system to locate the path to your destination. Next, this technology can be used to understand the apparent condition of your car to determine whether it‚Äôs mechanically safe to travel. Furthermore, this device is also connected to your smartphone to give you information about the location of your car when you are away from it. Another beautiful aspect of this technology is that it will not let you forget your important meetings and events. Since the system is connected to your smartphone and social media, it will keep updating your schedule.
Suppose, you‚Äôre traveling to a city very far from your home, this smart system will get the weather updates from the internet about that town and can inform you about the precautions to be taken. It can also provide you the information about the traffic conditions. HERE location platform is also capable of giving you the contact details of different emergency services nearby.
There are many benefits which one can enjoy using this technology connected to the Internet. The HERE location platform technology has laid down the foundation for comfortable and tension-free driving experiences.

Overlooking the 7th hole of the Rick Robbins designed 18 hole golf course, this lot is priced to sell. If you enjoy a pristine golf course with super greens, this is the place where you want to be. Golf fees are very affordable. If the beach is your desire, you can choose between Sunset Beach or Ocean Isle Beach since they are just miles away. Amenities include a pool, tennis courts, clubhouse, spa, gym, and of course the golf course. The owner will include plans for a 2400+ square foot home personally designed by a local builder.
Just before takeoff, I notice something different about the passengers aboard my Cathay Pacific flight, direct from New York to Hong Kong: Their airborne ensembles seem to be preplanned. There are metallic parkas, rhinestone-laden Gucci eyewear, and carry-on baggage far more stylish than my beaten-up duffle. I expected the Hong Kong crowd to be well-heeled, but all was revealed when I overheard a brash man take a phone call from the tarmac. ‚ÄúWhat time is the vernissage?‚Äù he pressed.
Art world power players were descending upon the city for Art Basel Hong Kong and so, too, were the revelers who enjoy all of the fair‚Äôs peripheral celebrations. Like its other iterations in Miami and Basel, Switzerland, the weeklong calendar of events is more than just an art fair; buyers abound and circulate at dinners, there are artist meet and greets aplenty, and, yes, more than a handful of vernissages.
But at last night‚Äôs amfAR Hong Kong Gala, all eyes were on the grand ballroom; its curvaceous candlelit staircase was covered in greenery and served as the perfect welcome to local and international guests alike, who were experiencing the highly anticipated property for the very first time.
Throughout the evening, the crowd certainly showed their spending power, particularly when it came to the evening‚Äôs auction led by Simon de Pury. ‚ÄúThere are a number of motivated buyers and collectors here tonight,‚Äù he said tactfully. The red-hot lots that were up at the auction block included a pair of Lorraine Schwartz sapphire earrings (modeled by Heidi Klum), which were sold for $50,000, and an abstract work by Eddie Martinez, entitled Night Flight, which, after much fanfare, was ultimately sold for $260,000.
Among the paddle-wielding bidders was Adrian Cheng, the evening‚Äôs honoree who happily walked away with a sculpture by Erwin Wurm for a cool $160,000 before being recognized for his contributions toward the eradication of AIDS. Welcomed onstage by frequent collaborators Pharrell and gallerist Rachel Lehmann, Cheng graciously accepted his award before rallying the crowd to continue their soaring donations.

Regardless of the condition of your marriage right now, it can get better and God will help you in that effort.
The marriage relationship is the most important human relationship we‚Äôll ever experience. God said the love shared in marriage is comparable to the love Christ has for the church (see Ephesians 5:22-33). Knowing this, it would make sense that God has given us the ability to grow stronger in our marriages. Regardless of the condition of your marriage right now, it can get better and God will help you in that effort.
In 1 Peter 3:7, God tells us husbands to dwell with our wives ‚Äúwith understanding.‚Äù Sometimes we men may feel like we‚Äôll never be able to properly relate to our wife, we‚Äôll never really understand what makes her tick. But God says you can. With His help, you can increase in your understanding of this unique woman. It won‚Äôt always be easy, but the rewards that come from your efforts will make it a great investment!
To the wives, God says to show respect for your husband (see Ephesians 5:33). This is something you must choose to do, not something you‚Äôll necessarily feel like doing. When a man feels respected by his wife, he will usually respond in a more respectful and loving manner. When he feels disrespected, he will often react in a negative manner. While you can‚Äôt control your husband‚Äôs responses, you can greatly influence him by the way you respond to him.
Let your spouse be who he/she was meant to be. You can‚Äôt control your spouse, because you were never meant to. The Bible did not say ‚ÄúControl your spouse.‚Äù To the husbands, God said, ‚ÄúLove your wife.‚Äù To the wives, God said, ‚ÄúRespect your husband.‚Äù The way we respond to our spouse influences them greatly, but does not control them. As we obey God, our spouse will be influenced and will eventually respond. Reap what you sow.

I‚Äôve just found out it‚Äôs National Library‚Äôs Day today and I couldn‚Äôt let it go unmarked. Both my Mum and Dad were librarians, in fact they met on their library course in their late teens/early twenties. Mum went back to her career as a librarian after she had brought up me and Alex, and became the School Librarian at Our Lady‚Äôs in Royton. She stayed there for twenty five years until she retired in December 2010 and the above photo was taken by me on her last day. Mum loved a good display and Christmas provided her with no end of literary inspiration. Check out a couple of 2010‚Ä≤s displays below‚Ä¶.
In my opinion Mum was an excellent school librarian, fostering a love of books and a thirst for knowledge in the students. Her library also provided a safe haven for young people who didn‚Äôt always feel part of school life.
Mum didn‚Äôt drive so one of my favourite things to do was to turn up at her library and surprise her with a lift home. I can still see her face as she spotted me and the delight on her face at the thought of not having to get the bus!! Ah the simple things.
If you or your children aren‚Äôt members of a library, I‚Äôd encourage you to rectify this immediately! Especially if you live in Oldham as we have an excellent library, life long learning centre and gallery with lot of free activities.

Aftermath of explosion at school in Farah, April 16, 2019.
Around 1,000 girls used to study at the school, from grade 1 to 12, in Nawda village, 20 kilometres from provincial capital, also Farah.
Mohammad Azimi, the provincial education director, said that unknown individuals entered the school late last night and fully destroyed with explosives.
He said that it was not immediately clear who was behind the attack, adding an investigation was underway.
Meanwhile, Abdul Rahman, the principal of the school, said that all the documents and books at the school were burnt following the explosion.
The school was second two be blown up in Farah in just two days.
The previous one targeted was in Tiosak village in the provincial capital.
Locals blamed groups with ties to the Taliban, but the Taliban denied responsibility for both the attacks.
We recently met with Hospitality Technology magazine to share insights about emerging technology trends for the publication‚Äôs annual research study: The 2018 Lodging Technology Study.
In this year‚Äôs study, integration moved up from 24% (in 2017), to 30%, as a top challenge faced by IT departments. Interestingly, the rapid pace of technological change demands that technology leaders evaluate and identify opportunities for continual improvement. According to Agilisys‚Äôs VP of Products and Customer Support, better integration is of strategic importance.
Hoteliers should expect all of their hospitality solutions to work in harmony. Property management technology is at the core of every hotel and resort, and while it helps drive a frictionless guest experience, it should also offer seamless integration with ancillary technologies. It must integrate and share data transparently throughout the enterprise. This provides the most flexibility to deliver a unique and memorable experience for guests while increasing the efficiency of hotel operations.
Agilysys delivers leading hospitality technology with comprehensive, seamless integration capabilities.

This is part 1 of the ‚ÄúHow Unreal Renders a Frame‚Äù series, you can access part 2 and part 3 as well.
I was looking around the Unreal source the other day and inspired by some excellent breakdowns of how popular games render a frame, I thought to try something similar with it as well, to study how it renders a frame (with the default settings/scene setup).
Since we have access to the source code, it is possible to study the renderer source to see what it does, although it is quite a beast and rendering paths depend a lot on the context so a clean, low-level API call list will be easier to follow (looking into the code to fill in any missing gaps).
I put together a simple scene with a few static and dynamic props, a few lights, volumetric fog, transparent objects and a particle effect to cover a large enough range of materials and rendering methods.
Disclaimer: the following analysis is based on the GPU capture and renderer source code (version 4.17.1), without prior Unreal experience really. If have missed something, or got anything wrong, please let me know in the comments.
Helpfully, Unreal‚Äôs draw call list is clean and well annotated so it should make our work easier. The list can look different in case you are missing some entities/materials in your scene or you are targeting lower quality. For example if you are rendering no particles, the ParticleSimulation passes will be missing.
The SlateUI render pass includes all API calls the Unreal Editor performs to render its UI so we will ignore it, focusing instead on all passes under Scene.
In this case the particle effect I added to the scene seems to have two emitters that require GPU simulation without collision, so the corresponding rendering passes can be run early in the frame.
It is worth noting the Unreal uses reverse-Z when rendering to the depth buffer, meaning that the near plane is mapped to 1 and the far plane to 0. This allows for better precision along the depth range and reduces z-fighting on distant meshes. The name of the rendering pass suggests that the pass was triggered by a ‚ÄúDBuffer‚Äù. This refers to the decal buffer Unreal Engine uses to render deferred decals. This requires the scene depth so it activates the Z-prepass. The z-buffer is used in other contexts though, such as for occlusion calculations and screen space reflections as we will see next.
Some render passes in the list appear to be empty, like the ResolveSceneDepth, which I guess is for platforms that actually need ‚Äúresolving‚Äù a rendertarget before using it as a texture (the PC doesn‚Äôt) as well as ShadowFrustumQueries which looks like it is a dummy marker, as the actual occlusion tests for shadows take place in the next render pass.
We create an occlusion query, issue it and render the prop we wish to determine occlusion for. This is done using a z-test and the depth buffer we produced in step 1. The query will return the number of pixels that passed the z-test, so if it is zero this means that the prop is behind a solid mesh. Since rendering a full prop mesh for occlusion can be expensive, we typically use the bounding box of that prop as a proxy. If it is not visible, then the prop is definitely not visible.
We read the query results back to the CPU and based on the number of pixels rendered we can decide to submit the prop for rendering or not (even if a small number of pixels are visible we might decide that it is not worth rendering the prop).
Hardware occlusion queries have disadvantages such as they have ‚Äúdrawcall‚Äù granularity meaning that they require the renderer to submit one drawcall per mesh (or mesh batches) that needs determining occlusion for, which can increase the number of drawcalls per frame significantly, they require CPU-readback which introduces CPU-GPU sync points and makes the CPU wait until the GPU has finished processing the query. They are not that great for instanced geometry as well but we‚Äôll ignore this for now.
The CPU-GPU sync point problem Unreal solves like any other engine that uses queries, by deferring reading the query data for a number of frames. This approach works, although it might introduce props popping in the screen with a fast moving camera (in practice it might not be a massive problem though since doing occlusion culling using bounding boxes is conservative, meaning that a mesh will in all likelihood be marked as visible before it actually is). The additional drawcall overhead problem remains though and it is not easy to solve. Unreal tries mitigate it by grouping queries like this: At first it renders all opaque geometry to the z-buffer (the Z-prepass discussed earlier). Then it issues individual queries for every prop it needs to test for occlusion. At the end of the frame it retrieves query data from the previous (or further back) frame and decides prop visibility. If it is visible it marks it as renderable for the next frame. On the other hand, if it is invisible, it adds it to a ‚Äúgrouped‚Äù query which batches the bounding boxes of up to 8 props and uses that to determine visibility during the next frame. If the group becomes visible next frame (as a whole), it breaks it up and issues individual queries again. If the camera and the props are static (or slowly moving), this approach reduces the number of necessary occlusion queries by a factor of 8. The only weirdness I noticed was during the batching of the occluded props which seems to be random and not based of spatial proximity.
This process corresponds to the IndividualQueries and GroupedQueries markers in the renderpass list above. The GroupedQueries part is empty as the engine did not manage to produce any during the previous frame.
Finally I assume that PlanarReflectionQueries refers to occlusion tests performed when calculating planar reflections (produced by transforming the camera behind/below the reflection plane and redrawing the meshes).
Since Unreal uses reverse-Z, as mentioned earlier, the pixel shader uses the min operator during downscaling.
Next follows the shadomap calculation render pass (ShadowDepths).
For stationary lights, the renderer bakes shadows for static props and calculates shadows only for dynamic (movable) props. With movable lights it calculates shadows for everything every frame (totally dynamic). Finally for static lights it bakes light+shadows into the lightmap, so they should never appear during rendering.
As the call list above corroborates, only Split0 has some geometry to render so the other tiles are empty. The shadowmap is rendered without using a pixel shader which offers double the shadowmap generation speed. Worth noting is that the ‚ÄúStationary‚Äù and ‚ÄúMovable‚Äù distinction does not hold for the Directional light it seems, the renderer renders all props (including static ones) to the shadowmap.
The single Static light does not appear at all in the drawcall list, confirming that it does not affect dynamic props only static ones through the pre-baked lightmap.
Finally a word of advice, if you have stationary lights in the scene make sure that you bake lighting before doing any profiling in the Editor (at least, I am not sure what running the game as ‚Äústandalone‚Äù does), Unreal seems to treat them as dynamic, producing cubemaps instead of using per object shadows, if not.
In the next blog post we continue the exploration of how Unreal renders a frame by looking into light grid generation, g-prepass and lighting.
Breakdown on how Unreal renders a single frame. Essential reading in my opinion.
Here‚Äôs a delightful halloween classic. Creep Night was one of the first PC games I ever got, for the first PC I ever had. I‚Äôve always liked pinball, and this is a very good PC pinball game. I also really like the little goblin mascot (I even made a wallpaper from a screenshot of him way back when. Too bad it‚Äôs long gone now).
Creep Night is a solid pinball simulation which adds things like roaming monsters and bonus games which just aren‚Äôt possible in a physical pinball machine. The layout is rather unique too. Instead of trying to emulate the long narrow shape of a conventional pinball machine, this game makes good use of the computer monitor by placing three playfields side-by-side. You get to & from these side fields via ramps, much the same way as with a pinball machine which has multiple vertical levels. The game has three stages and you can choose to play any single one, or try to defeat them all.
Creep Night is the second installment in the ‚Äú3-D Ultra Pinball‚Äù series, which has a total of five different games. The first one is just ‚Äú3-D Ultra Pinball‚Äù with no subtitle, it has a space theme. The third one is ‚ÄúThe Lost Continent‚Äù and has a dinosaur/Jurassic Park theme, it‚Äôs probably my second favorite in the series (behind Creep Night). The fourth one is ‚ÄúNASCAR‚Äù, and the theme is exactly what you‚Äôd expect. I never had the opportunity to play this one. The fith and (so far) final one is Thrill Ride. I played a demo version of this one and it was pretty good, but not as good as Creep Night nor Lost Continent. This is also the only one in the series to get a release outside the world of computers, it was also released on the Gameboy Color.

A Bob's Life: Who is on our Money?
The debate about whose face graces our money rages and I have heard some irrational and just wrong statements.
Presidents and Founding Father's have not always been and are not the only people on our money! Our money has seen generals, mythical gods and goddesses, inventors, famous people, and others.
Salmon P. Chase is on the $10,000 bill right now! Who is Salmon P. Chase and why is he on our money, even if the $10,000 is not in general circulation?
Martha Washington has been on the $1 bill twice.
Susan B. Anthony is on the $1 coin.
Sacagawea is also on $1 coins.
Mercury (yes, the Roman god) has been on dimes!
Liberty (the goddess) has been on dollar coins.
Indian likenesses have graced both pennies and nickels.
In addition, the Wright Brothers, Ceasar Rodney, Helen Keller, and John Muir have been on quarters.
On currency, 53 individuals have been depicted. You might be surprised about who they are.
Who is Running Antelope? He was once on the $5 bill.
General George H. Thomas was on the $5 during the 1890's.
It is amazing how different reality is from common perceptions!
Sinks--why did it have be a sink?
They Tell Stories . . .
Not so long ago, the idea of having a smart home only existed in the realm of science fiction. Today, home automation is quickly becoming an everyday reality the more smart devices you buy. Why limit yourself to a laptop or a smartphone, when all of the appliances you own could connect to the internet and coordinate with each other over a shared network? This is now largely possible thanks to the fast growth of the Internet of Things, which is another way of saying the internetworking of various devices. Technically, any object that is embedded with electronics can connect with other electronic objects via the Internet ‚Äì from garage doors to windows, alarm clocks, air conditioning and lighting systems.
If you buy a fridge, a washing machine or a TV in 2016, chances are you‚Äôll have the option to grab a smart version of these age-old appliances. But with each gadget you add, you also increase the vulnerability of you home network, and it can become difficult to track and monitor everything without the help of a smart home security solution that basically does all of this for you.
It is predicted that (IoT) devices will soon outnumber humans, and by 2020, the home automation industry will have exceeded $10 billion. Traditional internet security companies like Bitdefender Antivirus ‚Äì that have been developing antivirus solutions for home and business use for the past couple of decades ‚Äì are gradually shifting their attention to securing the IoT. Thanks to the rapid pace of IoT development and the ever increasing spread of smart devices, this is an entirely new challenge unlike anything we‚Äôve had to deal with before.
What is unique about it is that now cyber threats may cross the threshold from virtual to physical. Most smart devices come equipped with cameras and recording features that, in the hands of skilled hackers, can quite literally be used to spy on unsuspecting victims in their own homes. Some gadgets, such as cars, could be hacked and controlled remotely, but so could vital objects like pacemakers and insulin pumps.
Of course, any efforts made by internet security companies to rise to this occasion must be supported by legislative and regulatory changes in the near future. No one can say for sure what the interconnected world will look like in a decade or two. But what we do know now is that serious steps must be taken to ensure it remains a safe experience for everyone.
Some things never change. Sonny makes a mess and daddy tries to fix it. Not this time.

Hi, I'm In√™s Merino, a 3D Artist and Concept Artist/Illustrator working in the videogame industry.
By using the reflection of light beams, two eskimos fight for their honour. Who will win?
Nine years ago, KPCC hired a business analyst named Mark Lacter to talk about transportation here in Southern California and many, many other stories. Mark passed away last week. Tuesday morning is the time that he would have joined Steve Julian, KPCC's host of Morning Edition, to talk about some of the business stories here in Southern California that are topical and of interest to you.
This Tuesday, Julian sat down with Kevin Roderick to talk about the special reporting legacy Mark Lacter left behind.
Q: Kevin Roderick, the founder and editor of LA Observed, you worked with Mark for quite a long time?
Yes I did, Steve, although not as long as you, it turns out. He came to LA Observed in 2006, so not quite as long as he's been doing this.
Q: He had been with the L.A. Business Journal. What was it about his style, his writing, that attracted you?
Well, one thing is he was always just very clear about what he would talk about. He could take these complex economic and business issues and things like infrastructure and make them really interesting. And I thought he was the best of doing that in any business writer in Los Angeles area.
Q: He was so able to take complex stories and not dumbing them down at all, but making them accessible to everyday people.
And he absolutely loved doing that. This was a skill he brought with him from probably his newspaper days, and it was just something he really enjoyed doing. He especially liked telling stories about really complicated things that would seem boring in most people's hands, like the operations of the Port of Los Angeles or the airports. He just loved taking those and digging around and playing around with the material that's inherent in these operations and making a really compelling story out of it.
Q: One thing I noticed about his reporting with us was that, at the end of the segment, he would always have some sort of prediction: "This is not going to happen anytime soon." Did you find that coming through in his writing as well?
He did have a strong point of view, and I think that's one of the things that made him magical as a writer on the blog. Now it's also a hot button thing; that was what made him controversial to some people. He had strong opinions about things like transit in Los Angeles. ... [With public transit,] he understood it conceptually, and he liked seeing it work in other cities. He just was unconvinced that Los Angeles was the kind of place that was going to become transit-dependent or a lot of people would start riding the light rail and subways. [‚Ä¶] And he was only slowly coming around to that. ... It's just one of those areas where he was kind of opinionated.
Q: Didn't you try to handcuff him and take him onto the Green Line or something?
I told him, ... "Mark, one of these days." I've been taking the Expo Line downtown and enjoying it and riding the rails all over the city, and I was going to have to take him on. I wish we'd been able to do that.
Q: That opportunity will not come, and the hole that Mark leaves behind in his reportage, I don‚Äôt know how it gets filled in that same style, because he was just one of a kind.
Well, you know, your segments here on Tuesday mornings with him were, I think, very special moments in Los Angeles radio. You guys obviously had a very good rapport. But he was also communicating really important issues, I think, and it was a great forum for that, and he will be very much missed in this forum and all of his others.
Q: Who takes his place with you? And how do you handle that as an editor?
... He came to me in 2006 and said he would like to start writing a blog. He had never been online, and he really wanted an online forum, and it just sort of grew out of that. He took it from writing just about business to writing about city hall politics and transportation issues. And if it wasn't for him, we would probably not have a business component at the LA Observed. And I'm not sure we're going to have one going forward. It's going to be a matter of sitting down and talking to other people and seeing if there's someone else who would like to do it. But it may just be something that lived and died with Mark Lacter. Something we're unable to continue to doing, but I don't know that for sure yet, still too fresh.
A funeral service for Lacter will be held at noon Sunday, followed by a reception. More details at LA Observed.
Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated when Mark Lacter died.

I am a sculptor. My medium is junk. I work with wire, gears, bottle caps and broken bits to make things that are beautiful, or at least interesting to look at. I was not always an artist, though, and this article is not really about me. It is about the man who encouraged and nurtured my talent: George Viener.
Viener runs the Outsider Folk Art Gallery in the GoggleWorks Center for the Arts, Reading. It is called the GoggleWorks because the building used to be The Willson Safety Products and General Battery Corp. It was renovated and reopened as GoggleWorks a few years ago. The building still reflects its former use in many ways, including the old vault used as a coat room on the ground floor.
My relationship to Viener began when I visited GoggleWorks with my Grandfather. I showed my project, Cactus Jim, to Viener and he liked it a lot. Viener‚Äôs gallery is on the top floor. If you wanted to, you could just go straight up in the elevator, but then you would be missing so much. There are dozens of studios rented out by various artists, and a handful are always in. They range from self-taught builders who make things out of motors and irons, to a man on the third floor who makes landscapes out of pressed flowers. Most artists are willing to show you their creations. It is a simply delightful way to spend an afternoon.
Viener‚Äôs gallery is the largest one. His displays change quite often, as he both buys and sells pieces.
He is quite picky, and only displays work that he likes and wouldn‚Äôt mind having in his own home. The pieces he likes the most are by self-taught artists, using found materials, such as bottlecaps.

The pro-Moscow Night Wolves group has been turned away at the Polish border.
The Polish Government has declared that it will refuse entry to an extreme nationalist Russian motorcycle gang who had intended to commemorate the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany 70 years ago by riding from Moscow to Berlin. The pro-government 'Night Wolves' group, which was founded in 1989 and has a membership of approximately 5,000, has expressed their desire to recreate the Red Army's westward push during the latter stages of World War II by passing through Belarus, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria before finally reaching the German capital in triumph by 8 May.
The bikers departed from Russia on Saturday and crossed into neighbouring Belarus without issue, but Polish authorities have made it clear that they are not welcome in their territory. Border guard spokesman Dariusz Sienicki announced that "These people will not cross into Poland. Each of them will individually receive a decision denying them entry into Poland's territory." Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz went as far as to call the actions of the group a "provocation", a view which is shared by many people throughout Poland who are deeply suspicious of the actions of any organisation linked to the Russian government.
Last year, following the annexation of the Crimean peninsula, the Night Wolves made their way down to Russia's newest territory in a display of nationalistic force and solidarity. Numerous members have also proudly fought with the pro-Russian separatists in the ongoing conflict in the east of Ukraine. Additionally, Russian President Vladimir Putin himself has been photographed giving speeches to the group in the past and has even been seen riding alongside them. These factors have led to the organisation being blacklisted by the United States, a move which coincided with broader economic sanctions brought against the Russian government following the Ukraine crisis.
German authorities have also expressed their disapproval of the bikers' plan and have said that they will try to stop any attempt by the club to enter the country, even though some members already have the appropriate visas to visit Germany. "We deeply treasure freedom of speech and freedom of assembly in Germany, but we've decided that some of the leaders in the Night Wolves are not pursuing legitimate aims with these plans." said foreign ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer. He then pointed to the group's support for Crimea's annexation as concrete proof of these non-legitimate aims.
The Night Wolves themselves remain undeterred by these hindrances, with their leader Alexander Zaldostanov remaining resolute in his desire to carry out the group's goal. The publicity gained from their trip thus far has ensured that the presence of Russian nationalism is being felt within the heart of Europe.
Following the application of the legislative decree of 8 June 2001, n. 231, which introduced for the first time the concept of "administrative responsibility" for companies, Mediaset, in line with its pursuit of a style of management based on efficiency, transparency and loyalty, in all aspects of its day-to-day operations, has updated its organisational, management and control Model in line with the new regulations.
Moreover, also in the light of subsequent legislative innovations and the consequent extension of the concept of "presumed felonies", as well as ongoing jurisprudential adjustments, Mediaset and subsidiaries have made appropriate updates to such Models.
The updating process was carried out in conformity with the content of legislative decree 231/01, the guidelines drawn up by Confindustria as well as specific measures already implemented by the Mediaset Group concerning both internal control and corporate governance.
The Organisational, Management and Control Model pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001 was approved by the board of directors of Mediaset SpA by resolution on 29 July 2003 and subsequently integrated by resolutions on 18 December 2003. 7 November 2006 and 16 December 2008.
On 16th December 2008 the board of directors of Mediaset updated the document.
Independent update initiatives, relating to the company's characteristic business as well as specific sectors of operations, have also been taken by the Italian subsidiaries of Mediaset.
The version published here was adopted by resolution by the board of directors of Mediaset SpA on February 2015, following a process of analysis of the new examples of felony most recently included and recent orientations in jurisprudence and ongoing verification of the functionality and effectiveness of the Organisational Model over time and any opportune updates.

If you will connect with family members or friends on social websites, you will be able to use this for your own benefit when trying to raise some money for charity. In most cases, you will be able to use this type of websites to ask various individuals to make donations to your own cause, mostly in situations such as runs or walks where you have to find sponsors. There are websites you may use to reach out individuals who may be interested in your cause and who you might not know them personally. Every penny will add up, even if they will donate a single dollar.
1. Start by setting up your donation website through the organization you work with. Fill all the info, so anyone who may be interested will have all the details. This will also mean sharing why your cause is so important, and what you will be doing with the money. You should explain how people may donate money as well. Among the best possible ways is to accept money through online processing systems.
2. You should post the link on Facebook or any other social site. Post the link on your profile page, and then add a specific message where you can ask people if they would be interested in donating money. Offer details what the actual event will be about and what the specific cause is. Ask all of your friends on Facebook to share the link with their own friends. Facebook will enable a feature by a single click of a ‚ÄúShare‚Äù button. You may send your link as an event where you can ask people to check out your charity web page as well.
3. If you already have a Twitter social account, you can also send the link to your friends there. You can post at the end of your message or link the ‚ÄúPlease RT‚Äù expression, so they may share your link with their own followers. Another great way to reach out to various people interested in donations will be to look for a few keywords or phrases which are related to your own cause. For instance, if you are doing a walk or run for, let`s say, diabetes, you should search ‚Äúdiabetes‚Äù and then send your link as an @ reply to everyone that you find talking about this disease. Most people will make even a small donation if they are really interested in this issue.

Read first time February 8, 1991. Referred to Committee on Commerce & Labor.Contracting out for specific services.

My yard is approximately the size of a postage stamp. A 3,000sf postage stamp. That includes the house, shed, driveway, brick patio, 1 tree, 170sf of grass, and gardens around every corner- literally. It's my little garden oasis. At the beginning of every summer, it's a process to get it season-ready, though. Between cleaning up leaves, weeding, trimming the bushes. and spreading what seems like a million bags of mulch (ok closer to 30), I always spend more of my free time doing yard work in June than I ever anticipate. Luckily once the bulk of work is done, the daily and weekly maintenance is a breeze for the rest of the summer and we get to sit back, relax, and enjoy our little yard.
Prior to it's yearly taming each spring, the yard starts getting a little wild and with it's minuscule size, a little wild feels a lot wild.
In my minuscule yard, we also have a minuscule shed that needs to hold a snow blower, manual lawn mower, all of my shovels, rakes, and outside tools, and now a stroller. For me, not only is having the right tool to get the job done important, but the more compact the better...... cordless is a plus, multipurpose tools is a huge plus, easy to store is a massive plus. To help with this year's taming of the yard, Toro kindly sent me a couple Toro PowerPlex‚Ñ¢ 40V Max* Lithium Ion Products to try.
I first set out on the front yard with the Toro PowerPlex‚Ñ¢ 13 inch string trimmer/edger on the front yard. All 170sf of it. We use a manual mower that came with the house, but with each mow, we use a trimmer to get all the edges and anything the push mower missed. And the morning glories. I have a love/hate relationship with morning glories. Every year, by the end of summer, the metal fence is covered with beautiful morning glories (yay!) but they grow like weeds and will try to take over my lawn, garden, and anywhere possible (boo!)- string trimmer to the rescue!
This handy little trimmer has an extra long battery life (up to 45 min!) which was an issue we had with our previous trimmer. It can also easily rotate to be used as an edger with a guide and wheel. Multi-purpose tool? Sold!
They work great for small tasks, but trimming larger bushes... say a 12+ foot tall burning bush... is pretty much impossible with it. Toro PowerPlex‚Ñ¢ 24 inch hedge trimmer to the rescue! Please excuse the stank-face...I was glaring at the sun, not the trimmer.
I'm loving that it's cordless. In years past I've tried borrowing my dad's corded trimmer for the task, and this trimmer is so much easier to navigate than a corded one that you're constantly afraid of cutting the cord. It also feels so much safer since you need to have both hands on the trimmer or it will automatically turn off.
When at long last (or so it seems) the yard is finally tamed for the season, I get to take a deep breath, pull out my folding hammock, and enjoy the space all summer with minimal maintenance.
Thanks Toro PowerPlex‚Ñ¢ 40V Max* Lithium Ion Products for helping me get my yard summer-ready!
Dahlias, in my personal opinion, are pretty much the best flower out there. There may even have been a consideration that a late summer wedding would allow me to have dahlias in my bouquet. We got married late July and yes, dahlias were a required attendant. This year, I finally decided to muster up the guts and grow some dahlias myself. I'm not talking about the bitsy little potted dahlias you can pick up in the annuals section of the plant store either. I'm talking about buying tubers (the bulb-like roots) and growing dahlias literally from the ground up.
I'm so pleased to say that it is now Dahlia season and I've had some marginal success growing these gorgeous blooms. Mom grew them for the first time this year too, so we learned what to do (and what not to do) together. AND now I'm here to share them with you.
Watering isn't necessary until the tubers decide to pop their little green sprouts above the surface of the soil. If you overwater before they've popped, the tubers could rot. I learned this the hard way. I planted 18 tubers, and only 11 grew. Once they start growing, water your heart out.
Stakes are your BFFs. As soon as the plants reach a foot or 2, tie them to a stake. These seriously help them grow sky high. I staked early, Mom a bit later. Some of her plants got a little squirly at the base and didn't straighten out once they were staked. Mine on the other hand? Even though the tubers claimed 36"-48" tall, several of these guys are reaching well above the top of my 5'-6" head.
Aside from liking stakes, the flowers like being cut. The more blooms you cut, the more they produce. How sweet is that? It's like they're MADE to fill up vases throughout my house. Keep 'em coming!
Speaking of cutting them... As tempting as it is to cut off a bloom as soon as it opens up, resist! Older blooms will last much longer when cut. Once you do cut them, though, place them directly into super hot water (not boiling) and then change the water every couple days to maximize their longevity.
I'm beyond the moon about how gorgeous these plants ended up this year! My only challenge left will be to dig them up before the first frost and preserve the tubers to reuse next year.
What Dahlia growing tips would you add to this list??
This is one of those years where summer seems to be wizzing past even though it's just started. Where has it gone already?! I'm totally behind with our gardens and haven't even finished mulching the veggie garden. I feel like this should get finished before July hits.... tomorrow... we'll see what kind of motivation I come home from Grover with tonight. Nothing has changed drastically in my back yard/garden in the past year, but I like to share it here each year anyway- it's like my little garden year book.
It's going to be positively paradise once the hydrangea start blooming. It's my little suburban sanctuary. When everything is in full bloom late summer, and I've hopefully finished mulching, I'll give you the full 2014 yarden (yard/garden) tour- which will probably look very similar to 2013's. Between the front, back, and sides of the house, our yard takes 30 bags of mulch and only has 170sf of grass. Definitely skewed a bit, but I'd rather play in gardens then mow a huge lawn any day.
The newest addition to our yard is a monstrous rain barrel. I convinced Hubby that we needed one for when our town institutes a water ban (usually during a long hot spell in the summer) and we still need to water the veggies. When I tried to put the barrel directly under the water spout as I originally intended, however, it looked gargantuan and beyond ridiculous. I settled on hiding it in a corner, but now have to deal with re-routing the downspout.
Although I ventured to Home Depot for all the parts (which I did get), I got distracted by picking out plants for Grover and subsequently spent my afternoon playing in the dirt at the flip instead of installing my own rain barrel. I have a feeling this will be the story of my life for the next couple weeks. We are T minus 14 days before we hope to list Grover, the latest fliphouse. One-track mind may not even begin to cover it. I'll do my best not to talk exclusively flip here. I wouldn't want to bore you with daily updates of what trim I painted or what light fixture I installed. Enthralling, I know, but I'll keep it to my weekly updates.
Returning to my own abode and veering slightly off topic- guest what finally got ordered!!!!!
After 3.5 years of complaining about my over-sized budget furniture store sofa, he's getting replaced with the gorgeous Diane from Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams! She's certainly a splurge and will be the most we've spent on any piece of furniture ever.... but I intend on having this pretty lady around for a very long time. Now I only have to wait about 8 weeks for her to come in (sadface). Oh well, at least she's ordered!!! Can you tell I'm excited?
I'll be daydreaming of my new velvetty sofa whilst I manage to cover myself with dirt, mulch, and paint over at Grover. Happy Monday all!
The TaylorMade Spider putters are changing the game again with the Spider Interactive models. These are the same modern mallets made with a multi-material constitution for high MOI, maximum stability, and better roll. Now they include a BLAST Motion Sensor embedded in the grip that captures all your putting data and syncs with the mobile app to help you analyze, practice, and improve. The sensor is removable as well so it's Tournament-legal when you need it. A lightweight aluminum core is paired with a heavy stainless steel frame for a high resistance to twisting, keeping the face square to the path. The Pure Roll insert is angled at 45¬∞ to increase forward roll and improve distance control. This design features a single alignment line to improve aim.
How best determine best length, 33, 34, 35 in?
As a guideline for standard lengths, If you're 6 feet or taller, use a 35&quot; putter is recommended, if you're 5'9 inches to 5'11 tall, a 34-inch putter. Golfers who are 5'5 to 5'8 use a 33 putter. Be advised this is just a guideline. For bit fit we would recommend being fitted with a local golf shop or professional.
"The difference between a need and a claim is a clear-cut one. Nevertheless, if the psychic undercurrents have changed the one into the other, the neurotic is not only unaware of the difference but is indeed averse to seeing it. He speaks of an understandable or natural wish when he really means a claim; and he feels entitled to many things which a bit of clear thinking could show him are not inevitably his. I am thinking, for instance, of some patients who are furiously indignant when they get a ticket for double parking. Once again, the wish to "get by" is completely understandable, but they are not entitled to exemption. It is not that they do not know the laws. But they argue (if they think about it at all) that others get by, and that it is therefore unfair that they should have been caught.
"For these reasons it seems advisable to speak simply of irrational or neurotic claims. They are neurotic needs which individuals have unwittingly turned into claims. And they are irrational because they assume a right, a title, which in reality does not exist. In other words, they are excessive by the very fact of being made as claims instead of being recognized simply as neurotic needs. The special content of the claims that are harbored varies in detail, according to the particular neurotic structure. Generally speaking, however, the patient feels entitled to everything that is important to him--to the fulfillment of his particular neurotic needs."

One of the most basic problems with the ongoing improvements in gaming console technology is the issue of backwards compatibility. In the past, games from its predecessor would not be compatible with the latest version of the game console. Xbox360 games have this feature. There are ways so that you can play your Xbox games using the 360 console.
One way of allowing you to play both versions of the said games is via updating your game console through the Live system. However, it is required in this method that a broadband internet connection is present. The simple process of connecting your game unit to an available broadband connection will allow you to update your system.
After connecting, all that you really have to do is to wait for the process to finish. Afterwards, you can start playing your original Xbox360 games! By doing this, you remain updated about the latest addition to the games that are being supported by the system. Of course you would be needing a Live account, which could either be a Silver or the Gold membership package.
Another method that would to allow you to play Xbox games on your 360 console is by CD or DVD burning. This is for those who do not have a broadband internet connection. A simple dial-up connection would be sufficient for the download to complete.
Using this method, one could simply go to http://Xbox.com and download a copy of the game and simply burn it on a disc. This is especially useful for people whose consoles are not connected to a broadband internet connection. It also adds that you could get a supported copy of the game some place else, where an internet connection and a CD or DVD burner is present. This saves you from the task of having to bring the whole game console just to get the supported games. The process is just as simple as creating an audio cd. This should not prove to be that difficult even for beginners.
The last of the methods which would allow gamers to play Xbox360 games in a 360 console would be to order it directly from http://Xbox.com. However, this method would only be available by Early December to some people. But then again, it may seem as the most viable option. The disc includes all the necessary updates needed by the system to enable it to have backwards compatibility. It will be updating the program for the backwards compatibility, which would of course also update the operating system for your game console.
I should say that this backwards compatibility feature is really ingenious. First of all, it saves gamers all that money that would either go to waste. Waste of money happens because they cannot use their old games or they purchase new games. Although this feature only allows your Xbox360 and Xbox games to be played on the 360 console, it will definitely be a feature that would dictate future technological developments in the gaming industry.

Q: All of your arguments with signings like Shannon Brown are followed by "if" Dwyane Wade is healthy or "if" Danny Granger is back. I agree with that. However, this team should not be going forward like this. It's too risky. We need a better backup for Wade and the need at point guard has not been addressed, which was a glaring deficiency in the Finals. I know Pat Riley is not done, and as much as I hope D.W. is healthy, it makes no sense to risk the season on "ifs." -- Chet.
A: "Ifs" are what every team that's not the favorite carry into the season. I'm sure last year at this time the concerns in San Antonio included "if" the Spurs aren't too old, the caution in Oklahoma City was "if" Russell Westbrook could stay healthy, the worry in Chicago was "if" Derrick Rose could last an entire season. As for point guard, the worry a year ago was "if" Mario Chalmers and Norris Cole were good enough to get the Heat back to the Finals.
Q: Face it, to this point Pat Riley has done a very questionable job in putting together a bench that makes sense. You know better. Let's hope James Ennis or somebody unexpected will emerge. -- Matt.
A: All teams have flaws. What I know is that with Chris Bosh and Josh McRoberts, this team is better set 1-2 in the power rotation than it has been in years. And Shabazz Napier has a winning pedigree, so don't sell him short in the backcourt rotation. Perhaps he's your "bonus" addition. And there still are names and time out there. For every Leandro Barbosa that has come off the board, there still is a Jordan Crawford. And there also will be plenty of buyout names as camps draw closer, Jason Richardson potentially among them.
Q: I think what is frustrating for Miami Heat fans is that in some weird way it feels as though the last four years didn't exist. It is as though they have been erased from NBA memory. Does that make sense? Of course they haven't, and we have great memories. But LeBron James is gone and he was such a big part of the team. LeBron became an NBA champion with the Heat, attacked all the way through, and now back with Cleveland he is loved! Instead of the media writing about will the Heat make a record fifth consecutive trip to the NBA Finals (and this is how the 2014-2015 team compares to the prior years' teams.), we are still in a bit of a daze even though we understand why LeBron left. -- Stuart.
A: My response to that would be that even when the Heat won titles, Erik Spoelstra would say on the opening day of camp that it is time to move on, that you have to close the book on the previous season. There also is the reality that this is not the same team. If LeBron would have left and if Luol Deng was the only change, then with Shane Battier, Ray Allen, Rashard Lewis and others, it would have had the feel of somewhat of the same team. But there has been a significant overhaul. This is not your 2013-14 Heat or the roster that made four consecutive NBA Finals. Pat Riley has moved on. So, apparently, has the NBA. What matters is embracing what is next.

There are five major categories of brain waves, each corresponding to different activities. Meditation enables us to move from higher frequency brain waves to lower frequency, which activates different centers in the brain.
As yogis have known for centuries and scientists can now prove, the benefits of meditation are profound.
Meditation is perhaps the most crucial instrument to harness the power of thought, cultivate more peace, clarity and happiness.
Learning to train the brain and focus our attention is crucial to thriving and cultivating a peak performance in any endeavor.
Long-time psychotherapist Dr. Ron Alexander, author of Wise Mind, Open Mind, speaks of MIND STRENGTH, or the resiliency, efficacy and emotional intelligence that arise as we begin the process of controlling the mind. Mind strength is one of the most empowering tools we can employ to impact and improve all aspects of life.
Slower wavelengths = more time between thoughts = more opportunity to skillfully choose which thoughts you invest in and what actions you take.
1. Gamma State: (30 - 100Hz) This is the state of hyperactivity and active learning. Gamma state is the most opportune time to retain information. This is why educators often have audiences jumping up and down or dancing around -- to increase the likelihood of permanent assimilation of information. If over stimulated, it can lead to anxiety.
2. Beta State: (13 - 30Hz) Where we function for most of the day, beta state is associated with the alert mind state of the prefrontal cortex. This is a state of the "working" or "thinking mind" -- analytical, planning, assessing and categorizing.
3. Alpha State: (9 - 13Hz) Brain waves start to slow down out of thinking mind. We feel more calm, peaceful and grounded. We often find ourselves in an "alpha state" after a yoga class, a walk in the woods, a pleasurable sexual encounter or during any activity that helps relax the body and mind. We are lucid, reflective, have a slightly diffused awareness. The hemispheres of the brain are more balanced (neural integration).
4. Theta State: (4 - 8Hz) We are able to begin meditation. This is the point where the verbal/thinking mind transitions to the meditative/visual mind. We begin to move from the planning mind to a deeper state of awareness (often felt as drowsy), with stronger intuition, more capacity for wholeness and complicated problem solving. The theta state is associated visualization.
A simple meditation to use to begin the transition from Beta or Alpha to the Theta State is to focus on the breath. The breath and mind work in tandem, so as breath begins to lengthen, brain waves begin to slow down.
To begin the meditation, sit comfortably in your chair with your shoulders relaxed and spine tall. Place your hands mindfully on your lap, close your eyes and as much as possible eliminate any stimulus that may distract you.
Watch your breath. Simply notice your breath flowing in. Flowing out. Don't try to change it in any way. Just notice.
Silently repeat the mantra: "Breathing In. Breathing Out." As your mind begins to wander, draw it back to your breath. Notice that as your breath begins to lengthen and fill your body, your mind begins to calm.
Consistency is key. Try to do this breath meditation first thing in the morning and/or at night. Be consistent with your meditation. Shorter meditations on a regular basis are more productive than long sessions every few weeks. Aim for 5 minutes a day and add 1 minutes each week.

Re: Xbox One disconnecting. Wired connection. All other devices still connected.
Apologies for the connection issues you're experiencing, I appreciate it's frustrating. I know you've probably been through all the basics, but for us to progress with our diagnostics please confirm the following.
- Do you experience connection issues on multiple devices?
- Does Modem Mode change the performance?
- Does the time of day make any difference?
- Do all consoles on your network have difficulties?
If you get back to us we will do our very best to help.
No, it happens in router mode and modem mode just the same. I am actually running modem mode all the time with a Netduma R1 router.
Not just consoles but anything connected to the internet via ethernet has this problem. My wife never gets it with her laptop because she always uses wifi.
Same here, I have lost 50 followers on twitch over the past week from constant dropouts!
I've taken a good look at your network and the only thing I'm picking us is that your upstream power levels are slightly on the high side right now, but could be fluctuating. I'd be happy to arrange for an engineer to call around to investigate. I'll get in touch with you via PM (purple envelope, top right) to discuss this further.
It's been a few days since we spoke last so I just wanted to pop by and see how you're getting on.
Hello I'm having the exact same issue but every time I call support they tell me my connection is fine from the speed tests. I couldn't be anymore frustrated than I am now from going around in circles. I know the basics, I have done all the troubleshooting and now I have to put up with this farce. Could you please for the love of gaming tell me what's wrong? It's quite a coincidence that this happens to so many people within this time frame.
I have experienced this issue also.
This is nothing to do with your Broadband or outside network. - NO point in VM testing your broadband!
It is purely down to the Network/internal ports of the Superhub 3. If it was broadband related connections would not work on wifi, when it drops on your ethernet connected devices.
I've got the same issue everyone in this thread is facing. The only option is just to switch ISP. Lucky me! my contract has just expired. But even if the contract was still running, it's not valid as I can easily proof that VM is not delivering the service I subscribed for.
I'm experiencing this exact same issue but with the SH5. I have a SH5 downstairs and have an ethernet cable routed to one of our rooms upstairs which plugs into a Belkin mini ethernet switch (5 port). My xbox and laptop then plug into this mini switch as well. I will be pinging my router and xbox from my laptop whilst plugged in with no issue then i'll have a drop out for about 5/6 packets from my Xbox before the connection picks up again. My laptop stays connected as normal but just the Xbox which drops out. So annoying, never had this issue when living at mum and dads with BT. I've also plugged directly into the router with my Xbox and same issue again.
Taken my Xbox to a friends house not using Virgin and plugged in and no dropouts again. Tried different and known working cables at every step but no change. Had Virgin out to test connection but showing no issues. I am most likely to be changing ISP unless someone comes out and tries to swap out my SH5.
Massively poor up time with internet as well, always having issues in our area, working from home in IT as well which makes this all the more difficult.

Fasting for spiritual and health purposes is widely practiced all over the world, and is still a part of every major religion in the world. Jesus, Buddha, Muhammed and Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah all shared a common belief in the helpful and productive power of fasting.
We at Heartwood Refuge and Retreat Center know water fasting can be an excellent protocol for rejuvenating body, mind and spirit and want to support you as a destination as you undertake your self-directed water fast with the full support of therapies and practitioners who not only understand the science, but actually fast, themselves.
Fasting has been shown to help people recover from mild to severe health conditions. Some of the most common ones are high blood pressure, asthma, allergies, chronic headaches, inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn‚Äôs disease), irritable bowel syndrome, adult onset diabetes, heart disease, degenerative arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, eczema, acne, uterine fibroids, benign tumors, and systemic lupus erythematosus.
Fasting is a time when the body can devote itself to healing, repairing and strengthening damaged organs eliminating accumulated toxins and waste products. The body is very intelligent. When we fast, the body starts ‚Äúburning‚Äù the trash first‚Ä¶the damaged cells, tumors, waste products, etc.
This is a time when the digestive tract time can completely rest and strengthen its mucosal lining. A healthy mucosal lining is a crucial to the health of the body in general and a preventive or healer of Leaky Gut Syndrome. That is the leakage of incompletely digested proteins into the bloodstream, which are at the root of most autoimmune conditions and food allergies.

Bonnie checked the gauge. Red.
She slowed to thirty. The headlights flashed a pump beside the elevators. Bonnie pulled in and got out. She crossed the street and knocked at a house. A light blossomed, and a man opened the door.
He returned with keys and opened the co-op. He filled Bonnie‚Äôs tank and cleaned her windshield. She offered fifty.
The Meta-Story: This version is 99 words. To get it that short, I altered the true story. For a more accurate version of what happened that night in 1972, read below. I was the eight-year-old daughter. My mom‚Äôs nickname is Bennie. I made her Bonnie for clarity. We were accompanied by my little sister, but it cluttered my story unnecessarily, and I doubt she remembers that night Mom was scared we‚Äôd run out of gas on the highway. In those days, there were no mobile phones, no 24/7 Quik Trips in Copeland. You relied on your neighbors and the kindness of strangers. Like Mom did one summer around midnight.
For the last fifty miles, the headlights revealed nothing but broken, yellow line. Bonnie checked the gas gauge. In the red. Her eight-year-old daughter, Mindy, read the first sign they‚Äôd seen for an hour.
Bonnie slowed from sixty to thirty through the darkened town.
‚ÄúFive more hours.‚Äù The headlights flashed a gas pump beside the grain elevators. Bonnie pulled in and got out. She crossed the street and knocked at the nearest house. A light came on, and an old man opened the door.
He returned with a set of keys. Bonnie followed him back to the co-op, where he opened up and switched on the pump. He filled Bonnie‚Äôs tank, cleaned her windshield, and gave Mindy a jawbreaker from a jar inside on the counter.
Bonnie offered him a fifty on top of the gas. He refused.
‚ÄúYou two get home safe now,‚Äù he said.
I don‚Äôt know why, but when I first opened the story I was half-expecting a tale about Pansy. I must miss her.
This was a great story, and I enjoyed the explanation and the longer version. I once coasted into a small town on fumes to find their gas station had closed the month before, and the nearest town was still half an hour away. Luckily, I met someone in the diner there who had a few five gallon gas cans on hand and he gave me enough fuel to get to the next town.
I read the second version one more time, and that Cecil character certainly sounds like a kind man. I hope you have a wonderful day, Kecia. I think you just lifted my spirits this morning with this story.
Mandie, your story would be perfect for this prompt of the diner.
Pansy and everything else but flash for the blog and a couple of contests are on a back burner while I crunch and mash the structure of a novel. I have one more scene to write for what I hope is the last, large-scale change I want. I wrote three of the four yesterday. I was so proud of myself. Grind, grind, grind.
Thank you for reading. I enjoy your comments.
Haha I‚Äôm pretty sure the whole town was in that diner, and everyone stopped and looked at me when I walked in.
That is so awesome, Kecia. It sounds like you accomplished so much yesterday. I can‚Äôt say the same for myself. If it wasn‚Äôt for meeting with my writing group yesterday, I‚Äôd probably have nothing to account for my time.
I do remember those cases when time did not matter‚Ä¶ I think that you can still get help sometimes, though today there are credit cards‚Ä¶ somehow it‚Äôs easier, but less opportunity to meet and be met with compassion.
I have faint memories of pulling up to a farm tank in the dead of night. Mom stole a tank of gas, she did things like that. The farmer shot at us from the porch, but mom stepped on the pedal and we threw dirt clouds behind us. I was about 7-8 at the time and thought it was cool, like the ‚ÄòDuke of Hazard‚Äô and the ‚ÄòGeneral Lee‚Äô. That same farmer was later one of my foster dads, and he never let me forget what mom had done.
Memories are made of events like this, I enjoyed the second more detailed story also.
I was waiting for it to all go wrong. What a refreshing tale of kindness. Nice one.
No murders this time. I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed it. Thanks for reading.
Very much a different time. It was more the norm then for people to help. People do still help but just less frequently.
True. Thank you for commenting.
Bless his heart. Salt of the earth.
Many people like that still live in Kansas. Thank you for reading.
This was such an uplifting bit of nostalgia. Of such stuff are memories built. Well done, Kecia. I have always enjoyed your writings.
This is lovely. I really like both the longer and the shorter version. The only thing that I think is lost and I was confused about in the short version is that it reads like the man wouldn‚Äôt take any money, and I wasn‚Äôt sure about that. Still, really nice writing.
Thank you for reading. Welcome to my blog, Claire.
Lucky that petrol station was there and that the chap came out to help. I bet no-one would nowadays.
There are still a lot of Kansans who would help. Cecils and Margarets and their kids and their grandkids.
I love the story, Kecia. I live in a small community and one of the storekeepers was much like Cecil. Today, it‚Äôs all so impersonalble, but at least you can buy gas with a credit card in the middle of the night without having to wake anyone up.
I think we planned more for our outings and stayed home more. We didn‚Äôt hop up at 11pm on a milk run. We waited until the store opened the next morning. But my mom was a do-er and a go-er, and we were coming home from a horse show. (My older sister was a serious competitor.) My mom was also extremely self-sufficient, and that one time she was low on gas, she got us out of the trouble. Nothing slowed her down.
people were much more self-sufficient in that era. You had to be. We lived in the country and my parents only went to town once a week. If you forgot something, you had to wait a whole week before the next run.
Yes, Christine. I remember Dad waiting until after 7 to call his parents in Ohio. We all had to gather in the living room for our turn to talk. He kept an eye on the time so we didn‚Äôt run up the phone bill. Imagine that!
Exactly, Russ. Yet there was always something to eat. I remember my dad kept powdered milk in the case that we ran out before he could get to the store for more. He hated not having milk for his cereal in the morning!
I saw the name and thought of Bonnie and Clyde. Your story was an anticlimax!
I thought of them, too. I also thought of Holcomb, KS. This story could have very quickly gone bad. It was actually in the back of my mind as a contrast to what really happened. One expects something terrible to happen to a lone woman and her daughter on a lonely highway in the middle of the night. But, nope, there are decent people out there, too.
Thank you for reading, and welcome to my blog.
Its always good to read good stuff. Reality of life is horrifying that its pleasant to read nice things!
I agree with Iain. A tale of kindness is often needed and you delivered it!
Such a nice story. There are still good ones out there, I am sure. We have just become too scared to even ask.
Lovely story, I could picture the grain elevators and the dark pumps. I liked that the prompt took you to a simpler time and place.
I enjoy your writing style. It paints a vivid picture in the reader‚Äôs mind, even with only 99 words to work with.
Thank you. That‚Äôs a very nice compliment. Welcome to my blog.
Both of them were well-written, even the shorter one to fit the category.
Thank you. That‚Äôs kind of you to say. Welcome to the blog.

The Postgraduate Event Management course I undertook at The Fitzwilliam Institute has not only been very enjoyable and exciting, it has provided me with the perfect platform to branch out into the world of event management. I received great assistance with sourcing my work placement. Over the 12 week period, I had the opportunity to plan events for a number of blue chip corporate companies and designed their events from start to finish. I gained invaluable hands on experience working on a wide variety of events. Both the course and the practical experience gained during my work placement have reinforced my choice of career in event management.
1.) It was a good fit for me. This programme was well suited to me as a mature student, looking to return to the workplace after a five year break. It was informative, relevant, challenging and thoroughly enjoyable.
2.) It was a great learning experience - more than I expected. The course was very interactive and fast paced, with a great emphasis on practical skills - I retained what I learned by working together in peer groups on numerous practical projects. A great mix of students of different ages, experiences, backgrounds and strengths - This presented the opportunity to start building a network of event management contacts. The lecturers were all experts in their various fields and very supportive and interested in bringing out the best in each student. The lecturers drew examples from specific aspects of their work experiences, to bring their lecturers to life for us.
3.) The work experience offered as part of the programme was invaluable. Through my work experience on this course, I was able to identify that one of my strengths lies in working in logistics. My work experience took me abroad to work on and witness an event in the planning for several months unfold - A fantastic opportunity and unforgettable experience.
4.) Volunteering opportunities. We were given the opportunity to work as volunteers on a variety of charitable events from the very small lesser know ones to several very large, well known and publicised charitable events. This experience brought to life what we as students could possibly be involved with in the future.
5.) The right mix. This course had the right mix of perfect ingredients to make it the best course I have ever taken: brilliant lecturers, interested students, industry relevant information, practical projects, hands on work experience and with support throughout the entire programme from lecturers and peers.
It has been nearly a year since I finished the Postgraduate Diploma Course with Fitzwilliam Institute Group and I cannot believe how quickly it has flown by and everything I have done since then! After 3 months of work experience, when I was able to put all that I had learned in the classroom into practice, I went straight into a job working for a great sport event management company.

By , NAIROBI, August 28 ‚Äì The re-launch of the Fairmont chain of hotels that was to take place early this year has now been pushed to 2009.
The one year delay is being blamed on bottlenecks experienced in the importation of building materials, and further accelerated by the post election violence that rocked the country early this year.
Speaking to Capital Business News, Fairmont East Africa Managing Director Sean Billing said the renovation of the Fairmont Mara, Mt Kenya and Norfolk properties, which had initially experienced a one-year delay are still behind schedule.
‚ÄúClearing cargo at the port has been a nightmare resulting to increased costs due to taxes and extra transport expenses of the building materials,‚Äù Billing explained.
However, Billing said the group still intends to operate within the initial $35 million investment budget despite this hiccups.
‚ÄúWe obviously have had to make some changes in the renovation plans, but unfortunately the changes have been to try and stay within that budget. This will affect the overall quality but the renovations will still be ahead of the competition,‚Äù he said.
Out of the three hotels that were under renovation only the Fairmont Mara Safari Club refurbishment is near complete.
Meanwhile, the East African hotel chain boss is of the view that increasing bed capacity in the tourism industry may not be the solution to meeting the country‚Äôs efforts of fully exploit the industry.
Billing is of the opinion that until the sector is able to achieve steady bed occupancy through the year, there is really no need for new investments.
He observed that the sector needs to emphasise on improving product quality, which he feels is still low compared to Kenya‚Äôs competitors in the industry.
‚ÄúThis country has one of the most diverse products in the world ranging from beach, cultural, mountaineering, and eco tourism among others,‚Äù Billing stressed.
Though still optimistic that the entry of the chain into the country was not a mistake, Billing revealed that their revenues had gone down by almost 50 percent after the violence that rocked the country earlier in the year.
‚ÄúFor us when we combine the unrest plus the delays to construction which meant that we do not have full inventories, we don‚Äôt have our full spaces, then we are talking about our revenues being cut by half,‚Äù he stated.
During the last three years prior to the post poll skirmishes, the Kenya Tourism Board had been citing investment in increased bed capacity as the biggest challenge to growing the industry.

We are at a Catskill resort to celebrate my parents‚Äô 50th anniversary. Even in its heyday, the Homowack would not have been up to my family‚Äôs standards. It‚Äôs not that it wasn‚Äôt fancy enough‚Äîmy parents gravitated toward rustic North Carolina lodges. It just attracted a different type of guest, those from Brooklyn or the Bronx, where most patrons are more religiously observant and perhaps less refined than those of us who hail originally from Atlanta and Seattle. But we sought a place with kosher food near my parents‚Äô New York and New Jersey children and grandchildren.
When I asked in advance about wheelchair accessibility, I heard with my ears the answer that Mother will have to use the entrance near the kitchen. With my ears, not with my brain. I picture my kitchen door, and that doesn‚Äôt seem so bad. Arriving a bit ahead of my folks, my husband Julian and I check out the back entrance. I am horrified that my 78-year-old mother, the guest of honor, will enter through a swarm of flies buzzing about the garbage cans. How can I be subjecting my mother to this indignity? She finds her limitations indignity enough.
At Friday night services, I discover that the featured guest is the evangelical Rebbetzin (Rabbi‚Äôs wife) Jungreis. Oh boy, I think, as I look around at my genteel Reform cousin who looks like a swami in her impromptu head covering. I fear that the Rebbetzin‚Äôs fervor will overwhelm my family, who take their Judaism in small, manageable doses.
The next afternoon, Aunt Jo, whose beliefs are as fiery as ever, even though age ‚Äì84 ‚Äì has toned her flaming hair down to a dusty red, complains. ‚ÄúThey must know I‚Äôm a Reform Jew. No one says ‚Äòhello‚Äô when they pass me in the hall.‚Äù I gently explain that most guests are New Yorkers, who lack the southerner‚Äôs innate friendliness. My ‚Äúnothing personal‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem to reassure her.
Julian and I suggest a picnic at a state park for the geriatric members of our group: my parents, my three aunts, Mom‚Äôs nurse, and my aunts‚Äô three traveling companions. First stop is the resort kitchen to get sandwiches made to order: this without mustard, that without mayonnaise, another with no onion or garlic. I drive my little car and Julian steers my sister‚Äôs station wagon, leaving her and her husband behind to care for our respective children.
As we go up the mountain, I hear something scrape the ground under the car. I stop, climb down from the driver‚Äôs seat, and peer under the car. No branch that I can see. We continue, and the scraping continues. I climb down, peer, nothing appears. We drive a little further, more scraping, another stop. This time we all climb down and look. There seems to be more space between the floor and the road with the load lightened. Darn, I hope I don‚Äôt pop my springs. Too bad I have two extra-large people in the back seat of my little Dodge Aries on this steep road. I load my weighty passengers back into the car. Please, no disasters. I can‚Äôt imagine where the closest repair shop is.
‚ÄúB.J., darling, I need a bathroom stop. Can you find a place?‚Äù Aunt Emilie‚Äôs voice sounds more desperate than her words.
At a crossroads, I pull up in front of a restaurant with a sign, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not planning to eat here, don‚Äôt even ask about using our facilities.‚Äù I park anyway, and with Aunt Emilie accompanying me in baby steps, cross the highway to another eating establishment. This one claims no public facilities. We creep back to the car, then drive across the other way. This time I ask Aunt Emilie to wait in the car while I negotiate. I know I‚Äôm going to have to say things that will embarrass her, and I prefer that she not be listening in.
I convince the deli servers to let my aunt use the employees‚Äô facilities, a third-world embarrassment to the clean, first-world, New York State in which we supposedly travel. And I worried about what I‚Äôd have to say? Phew!
Mission accomplished, we continue to scrape our way up the mountainside to the state park. Now it‚Äôs Mom‚Äôs turn to use the facilities, a large, rustic, handicapped-accessible rest room with a toilet on one side and a sturdy hand rail five feet away from the toilet. It‚Äôs fortunate that Mom‚Äôs nurse and I are there to help.
At last we head down the paved path to lakeside picnic tables set among tall hardwoods. Mom‚Äôs smile while her nurse pushes her along the pavement among the trees displays her pleasure at the view of the lake. Julian and I move the canoe from car top to water, And I help my beaming Aunt Jo climb in. ‚ÄúShe sailed away on a bright and sunny day,‚Äù flits through my head as Julian pulls away from shore. They paddle back and forth, Aunt Jo mostly resting, Julian doing the work.
Are we having fun yet? Are we having fun at all? Why is this family group, who know and love each other, so serious, almost morose looking? Are the picnic benches too uncomfortable, the picnic food not fine enough?
And yet, at the end of the day, they rave to the stay-behinds about their good time. The final day, they all proclaim the picnic in the Catskills to be the highlight, after the anniversary party itself. I will never again hear the phrase, ‚ÄúAre we having fun yet?‚Äù without picturing the dour faces and grim expressions of my aunts and their travel companions on one sunny afternoon in the Catskill Mountains.
We had an almost identical experience for my father-in-law‚Äôs 90th birthday (I‚Äôll bet Dan & Ilana will remember it). It was also at the Homowack (and I did go to the Catskill resorts in their heyday) but that was not their heyday. The place smelled moldy, the food was classic heavy Jewish lumps of kugel, etc., and in general the place left everything to be desired. Yet I now remember fondly getting together with all the family to celebrate his birthday and of course the photo is priceless. Moral of the story? It‚Äôs the people, not the food or surroundings, that counts.

Despite semi-final loss, Para Team's future remains bright.
Canada Soccer‚Äôs Para Soccer Team will play a pair of international matches this week as part of the Tri-Nation Invitational Challenge hosted by the US Soccer Federation. The three-match series will feature USA v Australia on 19 July, Canada v Australia on 20 July, and Canada v host USA on 21 July.
Canada‚Äôs two international matches will provide an important development step ahead of the 2018 IFCPF Americas Championships in Natal, Brazil. It also marks Canada‚Äôs first international matches since the IFCPF adjusted the player eligibility rules for Para Soccer earlier this year.
The 2018 IFCPF Americas Championships runs 12 to 21 October in Natal. Two stadia will be used for the competition, the Maria lamas Farache Stadium and the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte.
Canada Para Soccer will face Brazil, Republic of Ireland, and Spain at this year‚Äôs IFCPF World Championships in San Luis, Argentina. The 16-nation competition kicks off this 10 September, with Canada looking to again crack the top-10 in the world.
Fans can follow the IFCPF World Championships across Canada Soccer‚Äôs digital channels from 10-23 September. Canada‚Äôs three group matches are 10 September against Brazil, 12 September against Republic of Ireland, and 14 September against Spain. Canada will then play three more matches from 18 to 23 September to determine their world ranking.
Coach Ferguson has arguably some of the best young players in the world, including 19-year old Samuel Charron and 20-year Liam Stanley. Canada‚Äôs 14-man squad also features the program‚Äôs most experienced player Dustin Hodgson and 50-year young midfielder Jamie Ackinclose. Both Hodgson and Ackinclose rank with Charron among the program‚Äôs all-time top-five goalscorers.
From the last IFCPF World Championships in 2015, Canada has returned five players in Charron, Hodgson, Nicholas Heffernan, Stanley, and goalkeeper Damien Wojtiw. That team finished in 10th place, the program‚Äôs second-best ranking. Ackinclose is the one other player with previous IFCPF World Championships experience, although he missed the last competition through injury.
‚ÄúWe will rely on the experience of Jamie Ackinclose to help stabilize a very young squad, but we know that players like Samuel Charron and Liam Stanley can both be our spark in speed and quality to help us reach our goals at this event,‚Äù said Ferguson.
This marks Canada‚Äôs sixth participation in the biennial IFCPF World Championship since 2005, with their best ranking a 9th place finish in 2009. Canada qualified for the 2017 IFCPF World Championships last year through the Qualification Tournament in Denmark.

Sleeping Giant is exceptional and affecting, a film both provocative and probing of the deep characteristics of these kids. Yes, there are moments that veer towards the predictable, but there's enough heart and grit in the telling that I found myself swept away anyway.
What‚Äôs particularly admirable here is the way the cast and filmmakers illuminate not just the wit and charm of young men, but also the callow cruelty of youth, driven by a killer combination of na√Øve idealism, solipsism, poor self-esteem, and raging hormones. Aptly chosen locations and production design collaborate effectively to evoke the scuzzy glamor of resort-town games arcades and golf courses, while Chris Thornborrow andBruce Peninsula‚Äôs elegiac score casts a spell.
Cividino digs beneath the surface, though, to illuminate male-bonding rituals, especially how young men jockey for position and try to assert dominance. Cinematographer James Klopko documents the gorgeous water and beautiful wide-open spaces where these boys are vacationing, but Sleeping Giant consistently undercuts the lakeside eye candy by reminding us of the boys‚Äô unfiltered testosterone, which provokes Riley and Nate to act out and impressionable Adam to follow their lead.
Avec The Sleeping Giant, Andrew Cividino annonce la couleur d‚Äôentr√©e. Son traitement visuel, bien que travers√© par de jolis instants suspendus, fait fi de symbolisme cl√©-en-main, de m√©taphores faciles et autres aff√©teries inh√©rentes aux premiers longs m√©trages sur le sujet.
With Sleeping Giant, Andrew Cividino sets the bar. His visual treatment, although crossed by pretty suspended moments, disregards turn-key symbolism of easy metaphors and other affectations inherent feature debuts on the subject.
Despite a conventional framework, whose broad outlines have been exploited elsewhere until their dregs Cividino successfully prints his sensitivity to the relationships that unite the three boys. Turning his back on sentimentality, he explores the intricacies of a period where everything counts for survival: the weight of words unspoken, buried fears, youthful delusions, etc.
Cividino depicts the tricky male power games between the boys with tact and compassionate impartiality: Adam may be the ‚Äúgood boy‚Äù of the group, but he‚Äôs not averse to a little brattiness. All three young actors excel, convincingly negotiating their characters‚Äô impetuous mood swings and surges of false bravado; newcomers Moffett and Serino return from the film‚Äôs shorter incarnation, while Martin makes a delicate impression in the feature‚Äôs most quietly complex role.
A massive, whooping congrats to @AndrewCividino and @karenharnisch on the @cannes premiere of their fantastic film 'Sleeping Giant'. Woohoo!

Canada‚Äôs economy is gradually recovering and is expected to grow by 2.25 % this year and 2.5 % in 2013, according to a new report by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Private consumption and investment will continue to be the primary drivers of growth in Canada, said the report, which was published Tuesday.
Canada‚Äôs growth will slightly outpace the OECD average, which is expected to be 1.6% in 2012 and 2.2% in 2013.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a great outcome. A generation ago, coming out of a recession like this, we would have thought this was deplorable, but it‚Äôs not bad,‚Äù said Peter Jarrett, senior economist with the organization.
Assuming the euro zone ‚Äúmuddles through‚Äù its crisis, avoiding a Greek exit, Mr. Jarrett said OECD wants the Bank of Canada to start raising interest rates in the fall to avoid speedy inflation that will follow the economic growth.
‚ÄúIn order to head off that eventuality, we assume that beginning in the fourth quarter the Bank would move at a rate of a quarter of a point per quarter, bringing us to a rate of about 2.25 % by end of 2013,‚Äù Mr. Jarrett said.
The benchmark interest rate in Canada has been 1% since September 2010.
A rate hike is also needed to slow down quick-climbing housing prices. ‚ÄúWe also feel that would help cool off the housing market in the places where it‚Äôs been hot and we expect it to remain hot in some of those places, particular in Toronto,‚Äù Mr. Jarrett said.
But if interest rates are increased, mortgages rates are also likely to rise, which could hinder the ability of some homeowners to make their payments. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to end up in the same situation as our neighbours to the south,‚Äù said Mr. Jarrett.
The OECD report flagged Canada‚Äôs housing sector as imbalanced, but noted stiffer lending rules surrounding mortgages have helped reduce risk. The report comes on the heels of a Fitch Rating report released Monday that called Canada‚Äôs fast-climbing housing prices and record household debt levels unsustainable.
‚ÄúThe Bank of Canada is doing its best to ensure that lending is taking place on a prudent basis so that if indeed interest rates do have to go up more suddenly than one might have expected, then the number of people who can‚Äôt afford their houses is not too great and the impact on banks and lending institutions isn‚Äôt too great,‚Äù Mr. Jarrett said.
If Greece does leave its peers ‚Äî the probability of which is rising, according to Mr. Jarrett ‚Äî Canada will feel the effect through the financial markets rather than through its exports or bank-based contagion. Mr. Jarrett said a Greek exit would trigger a rush for low-risk assets, causing commodity prices to fall, and demand for the U.S. dollar, pushing down the loonie.
He said Canadian banks are better positioned than some their international counterparts to withstand a deeper crisis because they don‚Äôt rely as much on whole-sale borrowing. ‚ÄúThe Canadian deposit base is quite solid compared to a lot of other countries,‚Äù Mr. Jarrett said.
Overall the global economy is slowly recovering, the OECD said, but at substantially different rates.
The euro zone crisis is dragging down the overall economic recovery.
‚ÄúThe crisis in the euro zone remains the single biggest downside risk facing the global outlook,‚Äù said OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan in a statement.
Heading into a European Union summit in Brussels this week, the OECD urged leaders to take immediate action to avoid a deepening of the crisis in the euro zone and spillover effects to other nations.
This really should be a list of 15 books I have on pre-order. Maybe someday I will. As for now, I‚Äôm just admiring them from afar on my blog. Check out any of these upcoming releases for 2018 if you want the latest and greatest YA novels.
Disclaimer: All my pre-order info is tailored for Australian teen readers like myself üôÇ I‚Äôm sure for many, such as the Brits and Americans, the release date may even be sooner (lucky you!).
Synopsis: Five years after the destruction of the so-called rehabilitation camps that imprisoned her and countless other Psi kids, seventeen-year-old Suzume ‚ÄúZu‚Äù Kimura has assumed the role of spokesperson for the interim government, fighting for the rights of Psi kids against a growing tide of misinformation and prejudice. But when she is accused of committing a horrifying act, she is forced to go on the run once more in order to stay alive.
Confession: I haven‚Äôt read this series, YET. I recently borrowed the first instalment from the library.
Synopsis: Fourteen-year-old Stevie lives in Lewes with her beloved vinyl collection, her mum ‚Ä¶ and her mum‚Äôs depression. When Stevie‚Äôs mum‚Äôs disability benefits are cut, Stevie and her mother are plunged into a life of poverty. But irrepressible Stevie is determined not to be beaten, and she takes inspiration from the lyrics of her father‚Äôs 1980s record collection and dreams of a life as a musician. Then she meets Hafiz, a talented footballer and a Syrian refugee. Hafiz‚Äôs parents gave their life savings to buy Hafiz a safe passage to Europe; his journey has been anything but easy. Then he meets Stevie‚Ä¶ As Stevie and Hafiz‚Äôs friendship grows, they encourage each other to believe in themselves and follow their dreams.
This seems a little too sad for me, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll appreciate the topics of government assistance vs resistance (aka refugee policies).
Synopsis: Two years after escaping Gotham City‚Äôs slums, Selina Kyle returns as the mysterious and wealthy Holly Vanderhees. She quickly discovers that with Batman off on a vital mission, Batwing is left to hold back the tide of notorious criminals. Gotham City is ripe for the taking.
Synopsis: In the wake of tragedy, neither Lazlo nor Sarai are who they were before. One a god, the other a ghost, they struggle to grasp the new boundaries of their selves as dark-minded Minya holds them hostage, intent on vengeance against Weep.
As humans and god spawn reel in the aftermath of the citadel‚Äôs near fall, a new foe shatters their fragile hopes, and the mysteries of the Mesarthim are resurrected: Where did the gods come from, and why? What was done with thousands of children born in the citadel nursery? And most important of all, as forgotten doors are opened and new worlds revealed: Must heroes always slay monsters, or is it possible to save them instead?
I actually hated the first instalment of this book; Stranger the Dreamer. But the book cover is so pretty!
Synopsis: The breathtaking story of five brothers who bring each other up in a world run by their own rules. As the Dunbar boys love and fight and learn to reckon with the adult world, they discover the moving secret behind their father‚Äôs disappearance. At the centre of the Dunbar, family is Clay, a boy who will build a bridge‚Äîfor his family, for his past, for greatness, for his sins, for a miracle. The question is, how far is Clay willing to go? And how much can he overcome?
Synopsis: The #1 bestselling series returns with a thrilling new story arc set in America!
Clues to Abe‚Äôs double-life as a peculiar operative start to emerge, secrets long hidden in plain sight. And Jacob begins to learn about the dangerous legacy he had inherited‚Äîtruths that were part of him long before he walked into Miss Peregrine‚Äôs time loop.
Now, the stakes are higher than ever as Jacob and his friends are thrust into the untamed landscape of American peculiardom‚Äîa world with few ymbrynes, or rules‚Äîthat none of them understands. New wonders, and dangers await in this brilliant next chapter for Miss Peregrine‚Äôs peculiar children. Their story is again illustrated throughout by haunting vintage photographs, but with a striking addition for this all-new, multi-era American adventure‚Äîfull colour.
Okay‚Äì I didn‚Äôt like the first instalment of this either. But you may have, and I want to let everybody know of the latest pre-orders!
Synopsis: At the end of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald was captured in New York with the help of Newt Scamander. But, making good on his threat, Grindelwald escapes custody and sets about gathering followers, most unsuspecting of his true agenda: to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over all non-magical beings.
Secondly: I have to read this for my boyfriend, who loves the movie for the first screenplay.
Synopsis: Dark secrets and forbidden love threaten the very survival of the Shadowhunters in Cassandra Clare‚Äôs Queen of Air and Darkness, the final novel in the #1 New York Times and the USA TODAY bestselling The Dark Artifices trilogy.
I AM SO EXCITED TO READ THIS!!!
Read my reviews for the first and second book by hovering over the links.
Synopsis: Emika Chen barely made it out of the Warcross Championships alive. Now that she knows the truth behind Hideo‚Äôs new NeuroLink algorithm, she can no longer trust the one person she‚Äôs always looked up to, who she once thought was on her side.
I really enjoyed Warcross. I‚Äôm excited to read the next one once it‚Äôs out at the library.
But her new friend has secrets of her own. She can‚Äôt stay in Havnestad, or on two legs unless Evie finds a way to help her. Now Evie will do anything to save her friend‚Äôs humanity, along with her prince‚Äôs heart‚Äîharnessing the power of her magic, her ocean, and her love until she discovers, too late, the truth of her bargain.
Synopsis: What if Ariel had never defeated Ursula? Five years after the (twisted) events of the film, Ariel is now the queen of Atlantica, and Ursula is running Eric‚Äôs kingdom on land. But when the sea witch threatens Atlantica once more, Ariel finds herself returning to a world (and a prince) she thought she‚Äôd left behind forever.
Synopsis: In this third instalment in the #1 bestselling Stalking Jack the Ripper series, a luxurious ocean liner becomes a floating prison of scandal, madness, and horror when passengers are murdered one by one‚Ä¶with nowhere to run from the killer.
Audrey Rose Wadsworth and her partner-in-crime-investigation, Thomas Cresswell, are en route to New York to help solve another blood-soaked mystery. Embarking on a week-long voyage across the Atlantic on the opulent RMS Etruria, they‚Äôre delighted to discover a travelling troupe of circus performers, fortune tellers, and a certain charismatic young escape artist entertaining the first-class passengers nightly.
#12 and #13 I have yet to begin reading (the prequels), but from all the hype from Goodreads, I just had to include them.
Synopsis: Felicity Montague is through with pretending she prefers society parties to books about bone setting‚Äîor that she‚Äôs not smarter than most people she knows, or that she cares about anything more than her dream of becoming a doctor.
A year after an accidentally whirlwind tour of Europe, which she spent evading highwaymen and pirates with her brother Monty, Felicity has returned to England with two goals in mind‚Äîavoid the marriage proposal of Callum Doyle, a lovestruck suitor from Edinburgh; and enrol in medical school. However, her intellect and passion will never be enough in the eyes of the administrators, who see men as the sole guardians of science.
But then a small window of hope opens. Doctor Alexander Platt, an eccentric physician that Felicity idolises, is looking for research assistants, and Felicity is sure that someone as forward thinking as her hero would be willing to take her on. However, Platt is in Germany, preparing to wed Felicity‚Äôs estranged childhood friend Johanna. Not only is Felicity reluctant to open old wounds, but she also has no money to make the trip.
Synopsis: When the California drought escalates to catastrophic proportions, one teen is forced to make life and death decisions for her family in this harrowing story of survival from New York Times bestselling author Neal Shusterman and Jarrod Shusterman.
This year I read Scythe, and I LOVED IT.
Synopsis: Elloren Gardner and her friends were only seeking to right a few wrongs, but their actions have propelled them straight into the ranks of the realm-wide Resistance against Gardnerian encroachment. As the Resistance struggles against the harsh rulings of High Priest Marcus Vogel and the Mage Council, Elloren begins to realize that none of the people she cares about will be safe if Gardneria seizes control of the Western Realm.
With tensions heating up in Verpacia, more and more Gardnerian soldiers continue to descend upon the university‚Ä¶led by none other than Lukas Grey, now commander of the newly rebuilt Fourth Division base. Though Elloren tries to keep him at arm‚Äôs length, Lukas is determined to and fast to her, convinced that she has inherited her grandmother‚Äôs magic‚Äîthe prophesied power of the Black Witch. As his very nearness seems to awaken darkness inside her, Elloren finds it more and more difficult to believe that she‚Äôs truly powerless, as her uncle always claimed.
Black Witch has been on my TBR list for so long (but I‚Äôve been put-off by the controversy of the story), and I was compelled to finish this list with another gorgeous cover.

For transparency, and to keep me motivated, I am going to toss in a weekly weight report. Thursday is a good day to do it since I probably have been eating fairly clean (before heading into the weekend that offers more temptations).
So thanks to some fast days (Tuesday and Thursdays... they are more partial fast days since it simply means that I pretty much have nothing but coffee (with some cream) and some fish oil, though I will toss in some protein shakes if I am working out (with a little BCAA )) I am happy to see the lowest weight in 4 years (basically since I got back from Afghanistan in January 2012 I was 245lb, and by May 2012 I was 265 with a long upward climb until my embarrassment point of April 2015 where I tipped the scales at 287.5).
Good job! I like how you are keeping yourself responsible.

Developing and tuning a new game mechanic is a ton of work, so it does seem like there should be some kind of protection in place, so that someone with more money can't just slap a new coat of paint on it and out-advertise you. But games are also iterative, and we need to let people expand on the ideas of others. It's a tough call.
Except for the Triple/Yeti Town case. That is really, really shameful on 6Waves' part.

How Nueva Ecija farmers are affected by imported garlic?
OK, OK, I lied, but that was the only way I could get bank executives to read a technology missive. This article is really about the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and why it is likely to be the most profound technical innovation in the first decade of the new millennium.
So listen up: XML is going to materially impact your bank, and you need to understand what it is and how it will affect the delivery and cost of information technology services.
Let‚Äôs start by understanding what XML is NOT. It is not a programming language. It is not a financial standard, and it is not a programming interface description. Think of XML as a set of rules and grammar that define a way to communicate. The communication is between computers, and the rules make the specifics of hardware, networks, programming languages, and operating systems irrelevant. If XML had existed in biblical times, the Tower of Babel would have been the Tower of Understanding.
Hopefully you are now getting the drift of XML‚Äôs potential. A few Gonzo issues back, I wrote about how the complexity of banking systems is limiting the choice of new systems available to bankers. (see Why Banks Are Not Changing Core System Vendors) In this article, I illustrate how banks are less and less willing to change systems because of the significant effort (read high cost and risk) of integrating the various disparate pieces. Well this is exactly what XML technology is designed to facilitate ‚Äî communication of information among computers without regard for type, style, brand, or flavor.
A typical mid-sized bank uses between 60 and 150 different software products. Surprised? Most bank executives think the IT staff doesn‚Äôt have enough to do, but you can be certain that keeping these products running is a sizeable task. The level of integration, or data sharing, among various products can lie anywhere between ‚Äútightly connected‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-existent‚Äù. In some instances, a file is exported from one application and imported by another. In others, extensive work is required to make the products interact in real-time. In most cases, there is little or no integration. Now you know why there are information islands in your bank.
The holy grail of banking information has been the ability to see all information on all customers at all points. Most of the systems described above have some information about your customers and your lines of business. Information technologists have been trying to tie the pieces together for years, with little success ‚Äì in part because a business case could not be built that would attach an ROI to the project.
But what if your IT staff could take two products out of the box, install them on your network, and have them communicate with no additional work? What if you wanted to take advantage of a new commercial account analysis product and you could just buy it, install it, and begin using it ‚Äì with virtually no integration cost? What if you could have products from 20 or 30 vendors and not be concerned about interoperability?
What if best of breed system strategies, previously limited to large banks with large IT checkbooks, were now open to everyone?
Make sure your chief technologist (CIO, CTO, VP MIS, or whatever) knows that you understand what XML can do for the future of your bank.
Make sure your current vendors have XML capabilities in their product plans. They should be working on them now and delivering products that are XML-compatible later this year or in early 2003.
Make XML integration capabilities a requirement for all future software system products.
Perhaps the promise of technology will finally be realized through XML. Can I hear an amen, Gonzo brothers and sisters?
The City‚Äôs role should be an advocacy role, one where the City continues to show leadership at the other levels of government, and advocates for what the citizens of Lethbridge want.
Advocacy, first and foremost. Maintaining strong communication with other orders of government is key in ensuring our voice is heard and respected. We also play a key role in keeping our residents informed when decisions that affect them are being made.
The city leaders should advocate for their people, and be a ligation between the citizens and the provincial and federal governments. It is the cities interests we are elected to represent, and when supported by our people our city could shine as an example to the rest of our province and country.
Advocacy on behalf of the People of Lethbridge is a key function of council. To wholeheartedly and effectively advocating for the People is a requirement of Leadership.
As local government representatives, City Council should continue to work closely with our Provincial and Federal levels of government. When decisions are made at a provincial or federal government level that affect the citizens of Lethbridge, City Council must work collaboratively for recommendations and solutions.
It is our responsibility to have good working relationships with other levels of government so that when we need to lobby on our citizens' behalf that we have open lines of communication. This council has those relationships and have been very successful in our lobbying efforts.
The City needs to have open communications with all levels of government, our MP and MLA's. Our role is to clearly articulate the effects of higher level decisions on our residents, to advocate for change if the effect is negative and to be gracious if a higher level decision has a positive effect.
If decisions by the Province continue downloading on municipalities, municipalities, thorough AUMA &amp; AAMD &amp; C, needs to pressure the province to direct funding our way to cover expenses.
The City must have a clear understanding of jurisdictional decisions. This would be as a result of excellent liaison with our local elected provincial and federal representatives. When these decisions affect citizens (ie Federal marijuana laws, Provincial labour laws, fire bans, etc.) the City must ensure that departments ie Police Department, Community Services Departments, are fully trained and prepared to deal with impact(s) resulting from these decisions. Committees and Town Hall meetings with citizens are paramount in ensuring communication and understanding of jurisdictional decisions, the City has to be proactive in these processes.
As with the legalization of marijuana, the city needs to support both the decisions of our government and the needs of our city. Changes don't take place overnight, and we have to have plans in place well in advance of any changes taking affect.
Advocate for the Lethbridge citizens.
Council is a sounding board for our citizens and a first link to the provincial/federal governments. The recent No Drilling Lethbridge decision was perfect example of people being outraged by big oil companies and showing the province that the "power of the people" is still a force in this province. Activism is the "rent you pay" for living on this planet and our citizens showed that to the rest of Canada and the world. Politicians need to remember that the quickest way to piss off an Albertan is to "tell them what to do"
It is important that council have a good working relationship, including open and honest communication, with all levels of government so that we may have a solid voice at the table. The city must abide by all laws passed on a provincial or federal level. It is council jobs to work within the laws to find what works best for our vity.
Advocate through and through, we need to work with all levels of government to obtain the most we can for our citizens. Future funding from the province and federal governments is in question and we must start now to advocate for funding for our future plans.
I believe City representatives have a duty, collectively to speak for the city of the municipality when another level of government adversely affects City interests. It is through open dialogue and diplomacy with other levels of government that solutions become apparent.
Are you talking about the provincial level? If so- Municipal Government Act (MGA) recently went through a major review and unfortunately it did not address all the needs of municipalities. Example- sections 66 / 643 that "grandfather" past decisions were not amended in order to give a city the power to apply changes regarding land-use bylaws; urban drilling/fracking are still under provincial jurisdiction. This means we are subject to 2 levels of governance. All we can do is what we did before ‚Äì fight to drive frackers out of our city. Once prov. legislation is in place its not possible.

This is an article by guest writer Don Campbell of Expand2Web.
Think of the greatest athlete, musician, artist or business professional that inspires you. The amazing talents that really stand out. Michael Jordan. Tiger Woods. Warren Buffett. They were each born with a special gift: wired from birth with talents and abilities that most of us don‚Äôt have access to, right?
Research is showing that it‚Äôs not that simple. In fact, many child prodigies don‚Äôt go on to major success in the area of their early gifts. And many of the greatest performers, athletes and business people never showed any early signs of aptitude.
So, how did they become great at what they do?
A couple of years ago I read an article by Geoffrey Colvin in Fortune, What It Takes To Be Great. The article is fascinating and delves into the question of innate abilities, usually referred as ‚Äúthe talent myth‚Äù.
Nobody is ‚Äúgreat‚Äù without lots of work. Early aptitude is not a predictor for greatness in a given field without consistent practice over a long period of time.
The most accomplished people in any field need about 10 years of hard work before they become ‚Äúworld class‚Äù. They call this the 10 Year Rule.
Many of these scientists are now saying that ‚Äútargeted‚Äù natural gifts do not exist at all. You are not born a CEO or chess grandmaster. Rather, greatness is achieved by hard, focused work over many years.
Charlie Parker, widely considered one of the most influential of Jazz musicians, showed no sign of musical talent as a child. He started playing saxophone at age 11, and was thrown out of his high school band because he was so bad. But this drove him to practice intensively for many years, for four years up to 15 hours a day. It was many years after that before he was noticed.
Tiger Woods started practicing golf at 18 months, and was encouraged to practice by his father. He had been practicing intensively for 15 years before winning the U.S. Amateur Championship at age 18.
But you and I both know people who work very hard. Many work for decades at a job or hobby without approaching greatness. Why don‚Äôt they become ‚Äúworld class‚Äù, then?
It turns out that it‚Äôs not just hard work that is required. What is required is focused, consistent practice over a long period of time. Something the researchers are calling deliberate practice.
Truly great people in any field devote many hours to deliberate practice. Deliberate practice is an activity that goes beyond repetition. It is consistent practice where the goal is to continually improve performance, reaching beyond your current capabilities, and seeking feedback on results.
Simply hitting a bucket of balls is not deliberate practice, which is why most golfers don‚Äôt get better. Hitting an eight-iron 300 times with a goal of leaving the ball within 20 feet of the pin 80 percent of the time, continually observing results and making appropriate adjustments, and doing that for hours every day ‚Äî that‚Äôs deliberate practice.
And what‚Äôs great about these findings is that we can apply them to all areas of our life. Almost any skill is improvable. Giving presentations. Sports. Negotiating. Whatever it is that you do and have a passion for, you can improve and become truly great ‚Äî if you are willing to put in the work, that is.
Approach each critical task with an explicit goal of getting much better at it. Set goals that are just beyond your level of competency.
As you do the task, focus on what‚Äôs happening and why you‚Äôre doing it the way you are.
After the task, get feedback on your performance from multiple sources. Don‚Äôt get emotional about it, and make changes in your behavior as necessary.
Continually build mental models of your situation ‚Äì of your industry, your company, your career. Expand the models to encompass more factors. (A good book on the concept of mental models is The Power of Impossible Thinking by Yoram Wind and Colin Cook).
Do those steps regularly, not sporadically. Occasional practice does not work. Consistency is the key here.
We don‚Äôt have to be born with a special talent in order to be great at something. We just have to have the desire to constantly work at and improve our skill. This is huge: it means that you can learn to be good, or even great at nearly anything!
Most people won‚Äôt go through the long and difficult process of deliberate practice. But this is what can separate you from the pack. This is what makes great performance rare: most people either don‚Äôt believe they can do it, or aren‚Äôt willing to do the work to become truly great at their passion.
So ask yourself, what is your ‚Äòmastery skill‚Äô? What should you work on to improve regularly, practicing, getting feedback, improving and pushing yourself to higher levels of excellence?
Is it your career? Is it a sport? Is it art or music? Now that you know that excellence is a choice, a whole world of possibilities opens up. Are you ready to pursue your dream and become ‚Äúworld class at it‚Äù?
When I read something that I really want to remember, I create a mind map to help me conceptualize what I‚Äôve read. My mind map summary of the article that inspired this post, What It Takes To Be Great, is included below.

With an increasing share of renewable energy sources (RES) in the European Union (EU), the role of energy consumers as active participants in the energy system is bound to expand, as developments in an increasing number of EU Member States demonstrate. A growing number of households, public organizations and small enterprises are likely to produce energy, supply demand-side flexibility or store energy in times of oversupply. So far, however, the extent of this ‚Äòprosumer‚Äô potential in the EU is unknown.
Global and EU-wide decarbonisation scenarios typically model increasing RES capacities, but do not go into the details of how this will be achieved, and what role prosumers, also referred to as energy citizens, could play in these developments.
This study therefore aims to create more insight into the potential of energy citizens in the EU: how many energy citizens could there be in 2030 and 2050 throughout the EU and what is their potential contribution to renewable energy production and demand side flexibility?
The main result of this project is an Excel workbook that contains the detailed quantitative findings of this study. This report provides the background information to these data, describing the context of the study and the methodology used.
The study was commissioned by Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth Europe, the European Renewable Energy Federation (EREF) and REScoop.

The word catechize, is properly Greek, derived from the verb katecheo, to instruct with the voice, which is found, in some of its parts, six or seven times in the New Testament, but is commonly translated to instruct; because in English, the word catechize has somehow acquired a narrower signification than the original term, and conveys the idea of instruction by question and answer; whereas, the word in Greek includes all manner of elementary, oral instruction: and it would be desirable to bring back the word to its original meaning. This, however, is of small moment. The passages in which the original word is found, are the following: Luke 1:4; Acts 18:25; Acts 21:22, 24; Romans 2:18; 1 Corinthians 14:19; Galatians 4:6.
It appears therefore that this mode of instruction is fully recognized in the sacred Scriptures. Indeed, if no other methods of inculcating divine truth were resorted to, than delivering elaborate and continued discourses from the pulpit, very little information would be gained by the young and the ignorant. Preaching supposes and requires some preparatory knowledge in the hearers, to render it useful in communicating religious knowledge. Elementary principles must be acquired in some other way; and this was more especially the case before the invention of printing, when books were very scarce, and few persons were able to read. It seems that the apostles and first teachers of the Christian religion were much occupied in giving religious instruction, from house to house; and we know from undoubted authorities, that in the earliest times of the primitive church, all who applied for admission into the church, from among the heathen, and all the children of Christians, were carefully instructed by catechizing; that is, by a course of familiar teaching, viva voce. To every church a class of catechumens was attached and formed a kind of school, in which the first principles of religion were inculcated, and certain formulas of Christian doctrine, such as the early creeds, carefully committed to memory, together with portions of the sacred Scriptures. In some places these schools for catechumens became very famous, and were supplied with teachers of the highest character for learning and piety; so that they were frequented by the lovers of sacred literature from other countries. A celebrated institution of this sort flourished for several ages at Alexandria, in Egypt in which Origen was educated, and at which he became the most distinguished teacher. A large number of the treatises written by the fathers, in different countries, and in different centuries, were composed expressly for the instruction of the catechumens. And until darkness overspread the church, and her unnatural pastors deprived the people of the Scriptures, the church was, as it ever should be, like a great school, where holy men of God devoted their time to the instruction of the rising generation, and of converts from paganism.
In catechetical, or elementary instruction, the grand secret is, little at a time and often repeated. Whoever would successfully instruct children and very ignorant adults, should avoid the error of crowding too many things into their minds at once. It is as preposterous a practice as it would be to attempt to increase the activity, vigor, and size of the body, by cramming the stomach with as much food as it could hold. Moreover, the truths first communicated should be as simple as possible. Tender minds must not be fed with strong meat, but with pure milk. To accommodate instruction to the state of advancement in knowledge, and to the degree of development of the mental faculties, is certainly that part of education which is most difficult, and at the same time the most important. That historical facts should form the commencement of a course of religious instruction, is indicated, first, by the method pursued in the Bible; and secondly, by the predilection of all children for this species of knowledge. But at a very early period, moral and doctrinal instruction of the most important kind may be connected with the scriptural facts inculcated, and may always be most advantageously engrafted on them. Doctrinal catechisms are, it is admitted, not commonly understood well by children; but it can do them no harm to exercise themselves in committing the words to memory; for it is universally admitted, that to strengthen the memory, it must be frequently and vigorously exercised: and will it not be much better to have it stored with words which contain the most salutary truths, rather than those which may, by some association, prove injurious on the recollection?
Sometimes the having committed to memory such a system as the Shorter Catechism, is of the utmost importance to an individual when his lot is cast where he has no means of correct information; or in case the person should lose his sight or hearing. We once noticed an exemplification of this in the case of a man of strong mind, who had led a busy life, without much concern with books, and who in his latter years was entirely blind. In conversation on the most important topics of religion, in which he took a deep interest, he would continually recur to the answers in the Shorter Catechism, which he had learned when young; and which now seemed to serve as a guide to his thoughts in all his meditations. But the true reason why so many children learn the Catechism without understanding its meaning, is that no pains are taken to explain its doctrines, and to illustrate them, in a way adapted to their capacity. Parents are, for the most part, either incapable of giving such instruction or negligent in the performance of this important duty. Most parents then stand in need of some helps to enable them to explain the meaning of the Catechism; and such helps have been amply provided, and should be in the hands of every Presbyterian family. We have works of this description by Vincent, Flavel, Thompson, and others of former days; and more recently an excellent exposition of the Shorter Catechism by the Rev. Belfrage of Scotland; and still more recently we have a set of Lectures on the Shorter Catechism from the pen of the venerable Doctor Green, in two volumes, which we sincerely wish might be found in every family in our church, as a work of sound theology, written in a correct and perspicuous style. And while we are recommending expositions of this excellent little compend, we would not omit to mention with high approbation, the Rev. Matthew Henry‚Äôs Scriptural Catechism, in which all the questions are derived from those in the Shorter Catechism, and the answers throughout are in the very words of Scripture. This in our opinion is an admirable work, and ought to be reprinted and widely circulated. We are also free to recommend Fisher‚Äôs Catechism, as a valuable doctrinal work, which has been much used in Scotland, and by many Presbyterians in this country. The Key to the Shorter Catechism, we also approve, and from the testimony of those who have tried it, we are led to believe, it may be made very useful in aiding children to understand the meaning of words and phrases used in the Catechism.
The old Presbyterian custom of devoting the Sabbath evening, sacredly, to the business of catechizing the children and domestics, in every family, ought to be revived among us where it has fallen into disuse; no other means which have been substituted for this, are likely to answer as good a purpose. Or, if public services in the church are considered on the whole expedient, on this evening, let an hour in the morning, or immediately after dinner be appropriated to this important work. It is as useful to parents, as to children; and is the most effectual method of inducing young persons to commit the Catechism well to memory. And unless this is done, the religious instruction of servants and domestics will be neglected. These family instructions should be conducted with great gravity and kindness of manner; at such times, chiding and scolding should be avoided; and the addresses to the consciences of delinquents should be made with affectionate tenderness.
We do earnestly hope that attention to doctrinal instruction will not be relinquished, nor diminished in our church. Hitherto, Presbyterians have been distinguished above all people in the world, for a correct and thorough knowledge of the tenets of their own church. No people on earth are so well indoctrinated in the principles of religion, and in the proof of the doctrines believed, as the Scotch, and their descendants in Ireland and America. Other people far exceed them in metaphysical speculations, and in the knowledge of other matters; but for sound religious knowledge, commend us to Scotch Presbyterians of every sect.
The benefits of thorough instruction in the doctrines of religion cannot be calculated. The truths thus received into the mind may prove ineffectual, in some cases, to restrain from open sin; but even in these, the force of the truth is often felt, and the person thus situated, is much more likely to be convinced of the error of his ways than those transgressors whose minds are almost totally destitute of the knowledge of the doctrines of religion. There is, moreover, an unspeakable benefit from the possession of correct doctrinal information, when the mind falls under serious impressions of religion; for then, truths which had been early inculcated, and long forgotten, will revive in the memory, and serve to guard the anxious mind from those enthusiastic errors into which ignorant persons are so prone to fall when they are deeply exercised on the subject of their salvation. Let not the members of the Presbyterian Church, therefore, become remiss in that which has ever been her most honorable distinction; the careful initiation of children into the doctrines of religion, contained in her Catechisms; than which we believe, a sounder system of theoretical and practical theology, cannot be found in any language.
We cannot be contented to let the opportunity pass of bestowing merited commendation on those denominations of Scotch Presbyterians who are not in communion with the General Assembly, for their indefatigable industry and care in giving doctrinal instruction to their children. In this respect, it must be acknowledged, they greatly excel all other denominations of Christians in our country. Among them, we have reason to believe, there has been no falling off in attention to the Catechisms; and few instances ever occur of the members of these churches being seduced by the insidious arts of the propagators of error and infidelity.
The question may occur to some, To whom does it belong to give catechetical instruction? We answer, to all who are capable of teaching anything of divine truth correctly. But, especially, it is the duty of parents, guardians, masters, school-masters, elders and ministers. All who can be enlisted in the service should be engaged to teach those more ignorant than themselves. And we feel constrained to give our testimony strongly in favor of Sunday Schools, in which so many persons are employed, so beneficially to themselves and others, in giving instruction out of the Bible. When this is called a new institution, it surely is not meant that any new instruction is given; or that there is anything new in the manner of communicating religious knowledge. The whole novelty of the thing consists in the success of the attempt to engage such a multitude of teachers in giving lessons, and such a multitude of scholars in learning them. But we would respectfully ask, whether parents, and ministers, and elders, have not become more remiss in catechizing since the introduction of Sunday School?
In order to render the public catechizing of children profitable, the pastor of the flock must manifest a deep and lively interest in the exercise. If he should appear indifferent, and attend on catechetical exercise in a formal or careless manner, no great good can be expected to arise from such meetings; but if he will take pains to arrange all the circumstances of such exercises, so as to render them interesting to old and young; if he will propose special subjects of inquiry, refer to proper books, and converse freely with his people on this topic, a spirit of investigation will be excited, religious knowledge will be pursued with diligence and alacrity, and catechizing will be found to be the most effectual means of diffusing correct information on the doctrines of religion.
If common schools were what they ought to be, seminaries in which Christian doctrine was carefully taught, then our schoolmasters would all be catechists, and the children would be trained in the knowledge of God, and their duty. The business of catechizing youth seems also to be one of the appropriate duties of the eldership; for surely these officers ought not to be restricted to mere matters of order and government. As leaders of the people, they should go before them in religious instruction; and it would be an expedient, as it is a common arrangement, to have each parish so divided into districts, that every elder would have a little charge of his own to look after, the families within which he might frequently visit, and where he might frequently collect and catechize the youth. If ruling elders are commonly incompetent to perform such a work as this, they are unfit for the office which they hold, and can be of little service in the church in other respects. It is now becoming matter of common complaint, that our ruling elders are not generally sensible of the important duties which belong to their office, and are not well qualified to perform them. But how can this evil be remedied? We answer, that the effectual remedy will be found in an increased attention to instruction in the doctrines of the church, by which means many will acquire a taste and thirst for religious knowledge; and whenever this occurs, there will be rapid progress in the acquisition of such a fund of sound theology, as will qualify them to communicate instruction to the young and ignorant. In the mean time, let every pastor meet with the elders of his church, once in the week, for the express purpose of discussing questions which relate to the duties belonging to their office: and thus those who are really desirous of executing their office in a faithful and intelligent manner, will become better and better prepared for their important work every year.
The question has often been agitated whether it would not be expedient to have an order of catechists, whose duty it should be to attend to this whole concern; and the idea has been favorably entertained by some in the Presbyterian church. But to us it appears, that such an office would be worse than useless: for, if the catechist be taken from among the members of the church, where he is expected to officiate, and this must be the case if every church is supplied with one or more, then why not constitute him at once a ruling elder? Surely the mere name of catechist would not qualify him to give instruction; and if he is qualified, would he not be as able to teach, if called by the name elder as catechist? And if the office is judged to be expedient, because we cannot obtain well qualified elders, how can it be supposed that competent catechists could be found? The idea of some, however, is, that to perform the duties of catechizing well, requires much more time than men can commonly afford from their own business; and therefore, proper persons should be employed at a reasonable salary, to devote their whole time to this important branch of instruction. Now all this is very reasonable, and brings us to the very point mentioned before, viz. that schools, among Christians, should have it as their chief object, to bring up children in the knowledge of divine things; and the proper catechists of the church would be the teachers of these schools. If it be said, that school-masters are often incompetent to perform this part of their duty; we reply, that the same thing would be true if they were called catechists; or if other persons were sought for, in the present state of the church, there would exist the same difficulty in obtaining them as there is now in finding well qualified school-masters. The truth is, the church should take pains to train men for this very office; and the parents should set a much higher value on it, than they have been accustomed to do; and the office ought to be rendered more respectable, and more desirable than it is at present.
It may, perhaps, be thought by some, that the prevalence of Sunday schools renders it unnecessary for church officers to concern themselves with the instruction of the youth under their charge. If, indeed, the schools of this description within the parish are under the special superintendence and tuition of the Pastor and Elders, there is no good reason why catechetical instruction should not be given in a Sunday school as well as anywhere else. Catechizing is an exercise peculiarly suited to the Sabbath, and if the officers of any church should agree to conduct this part of the instruction in these valuable institutions, it would certainly be an improvement on the plan on which they are commonly conducted. But when, as is commonly the case, these schools are made up of children of different denominations, and are under the direction of persons not connected with any one church, their existence and prosperity, while it will greatly facilitate pastoral labors, ought not to be considered as a substitute for catechizing. We are afraid, however, that some pastors, as well as many parents, have become remiss in this part of their duty, from the mistaken idea, that their labors in this field are now superseded. This mistake should be carefully counteracted; and while the benefits of Sunday school are gratefully acknowledged, the instruction of our youth in the Catechisms of our own church should be pursued with increasing diligence.
The old Presbyterian plan of conducting catechizing did not confine this method of instruction to children and youth, but extended it to all persons except the officers of the church. And certainly one of the chief hindrances to the success of catechetical instruction has been that it commonly terminates too soon. When children have arrived at the age of twelve or fourteen years, they take up the opinion that they are too big and too old to repeat the catechism; in consequence of which, until the institution of Bible classes, our youth received no appropriate instruction, in many congregations, in that period of their lives which of all others is most important for improvement in knowledge. While we are strong advocates for catechetical instruction, we are at the same time warm friends to the method of instruction pursued in Bible classes; and we should be pleased to see both these methods of instruction extended to all ages and conditions of men; for who is there that has not something yet to learn? And what upon earth is so worthy of time and pains as the knowledge of God‚Äôs word, and the doctrines of his wonderful love and grace? Every man who contributes to the increase of this kind of learning by his writings, should be deemed more a public benefactor than he who invents the most useful machine. Let all, then, whom God has entrusted with so excellent a talent as that of writing well on theology, take heed that they do not hide it in a napkin or bury it in the earth; for never was there a time when there was a greater need of good books and tracts to counteract the floods of error which are issuing from a thousand sources; and never was there a period when the effect of good writing was so extensive. By means of the improvements in printing, and the facilities of conveyance in our day, opportunity is afforded of circulating opinions throughout the land; and if religious men sleep, there is no doubt that the enemy will sow his tares plentifully. Let the friends of truth, therefore, be watchful and wise, and ever on the alert, in seizing opportunities of enlightening the world with the pure doctrines of the word of God.

Family Photography is not supposed to be something you ‚Äòhave to do‚Äô, it should be fun!! It should be about you spending time away from house work, chores, computers, phones and all those other distracting things and just having fun with your family. Generally this will involve chasing light, or in the case of these guys, jumping fences to chase light. Its ok, no one caught us! hehe. I also love a good muck around with confetti and bubbles (Kmart you rock for bubbles and confetti!). I love the faces that the kids get when I say I have a surprise in my bag for them, it‚Äôs truly priceless!
The weekend just past I headed on a little road trip with my finance Caleb to visit his parents in Echuca. With a busy wedding season, lots of family sessions in time for Christmas and lots of little bubs coming into the studio i‚Äôve had a super busy past few months. So it was really nice to take a break. We headed down through Benella and then to Shepparton where Caleb let me go a little bit loose in a few Op Shops (Vinnies was my favourite in Shepparton). Op Shops are my favourite place to shop! You just never know what you‚Äôll find. And Caleb is so patient waiting there for me. This time we even found him a pair of shorts! Anyway, we made our way to Echuca and enjoyed an even of cooking (Caleb‚Äôs dad is an amazing cook!), a few drinks, sunshine and then we settled around the fire listening to Jack Johnson play in the background. It was simply bliss. Just to relax, chat, laugh, eat.
So what do you do in your family fun time? Do you hang out with other families maybe? Go for a picnic (cant go wrong with a good cheese platter, lets be honest)? Or down to the park?
Enjoy some fun moments from this session!

Please take care and Get well soon, Vicky!
If you‚Äôre considering undertaking a significant project like an engine swap on any vehicle at all, you should spend some time considering the level of involvement you want and, perhaps more importantly what your budget will allow. Let‚Äôs face it, if your wallet is big enough, you can have an engine installed in your Fiero without even getting your hands dirty. On the other hand, this site is geared towards those with a limited budget who might be looking for a fun project to work on. At many points during the build, you might have the option to purchase a part, kit or service to simplify the process, like a wiring loom or engine mounts for example, time constraints may play a part here as well.
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much value to be had in going over the ‚Äòstandard‚Äô tools that you might need like a socket set, wrenches, screw drivers, pliers, vise grips, hammer, etc other than to recommend that you get decent quality tools. I personally, always try to buy tools with a lifetime warranty, like Mastercraft or better still Craftsman ‚Äì on the two occasions that I have returned a Craftsman tool, I got a straight exchange immediately, no receipt required and no paperwork to fill out.
One thing that almost caught me out near the completion of my project was insurance. It hadn‚Äôt really occurred to me that ‚Äòregular‚Äô insurance companies might not be overly enthusiastic about insuring a heavily modified vehicle. Fortunately, I found a company called Zehr‚Äôs that offers a special classic car insurance. This allows me to drive the car but with some limitations, for example, I have to have another main vehicle insured and I don‚Äôt use the Fiero as a daily driver. It also requires the car to be of a certain vintage, so bear that in mind if you‚Äôre starting with a more modern vehicle. One of the requirements for getting the insurance was that I had to get the car appraised. Kijiji provided contact details for quite a few local appraisers, I paid $130 for a nice, well presented report and valuation. Right now I‚Äôm happy to use my Fiero as a toy so I haven‚Äôt found a way to insure a 3800 SC Fiero as a daily driver, if you have, please use the contact us page to let me know how.
As well as the insurance, you should also check out the local laws concerning how to register your modifications and get your project legally road-worthy. Here in Ontario, Canada, I was able to get a safety inspection done, change the number of cylinders on the registration document and then get ‚Äòfit for road use‚Äô plates on the vehicle. When I registered the car in my name, the book of values used to calculate the tax reported zero value, probably just based on age. So instead, I had to get another appraisal (that basically consisted of a form that needs to be completed by a approved appraiser) to get a value that they then used to calculate how much tax I had to pay. Just make sure that you understand what‚Äôs needed to get road legal before you invest too much of your time and/or money.
Oh man, I tore the pockets on quite a few sets of pants and overalls getting to the workbench in those days!
Obviously, you will need a good selection of tools to complete your project, perhaps the first thing you will need (and needs to be thought of in the section above) is a good workbench. I was fotunate enough to pick up an old hand made carpenters bench for free, I repaired the top with an old wooden mantel piece and now it is brilliant! On the workbench I fitted a large vise that my brother-in-law kindly fixed me up with, it has been invaluable throughout the build ‚Ä¶ and still is.
Certainly a welder should get some careful consideration. Even though mine has been gathering dust lately, I don‚Äôt know how I ever managed without one in the past. I went with a Lincoln Flux-Cored Arc Welder (FCAW) after hitting some reliability issues with the feed mechanism on a cheaper brand ‚Äì as my brother will tell you, buy cheap, buy twice! I taught myself to weld through a great deal of practise when fixing up an Eagle Talon. If you‚Äôre new to welding though, it would be well worth seeing if there are any courses at the local college or something so that you can get an appreciation of things like weld penetration and proper welding techniques. One of the most difficult things I find with welding is working with thin and/or corroded metal, even on low power settings, you end up blowing holes all over. The only thing I have found to help, is to try to put a bit of extra time and effort into cleaning and preparing the area to ensure good electrical contact. If you‚Äôre going to be doing some welding then you will almost certainly need some metal working tools like a saw, angle grinder, hand files, etc and make sure that you have a fire extinguisher readily available, BEFORE you start!
If you‚Äôre starting with a full car and have to remove the existing power plant, it won‚Äôt be long before you need a hoist. I didn‚Äôt think about needing a hoist until I had the engine on the trailer ready to take home and it dawned on me that I had no way to lift it off! I was lucky that the guy that sold me the engine also agreed to sell me his hoist and didn‚Äôt rip me off! Of course, now I have this thing stood in my garage and only really need it if I want to take the engine out again (maybe this winter?).
This is a good time to bring up lifting safety, it pays to be very careful when lifting heavy objects. Ensure that all the lifting equipment, including the chain/straps are rated for the mass of the object being lifted and always check the condition of your equipment. I was using some heavy duty tie-downs wrapped around the engine to lift it at first, until I noticed that a small bolt on the bottom of the engine had ripped a hole in one of the straps. After that I got some chain and used that instead but I also used a temporary link for hooking and un-hooking the chain, even though the link was rated well above the weight of the engine, it failed and scared the life out of me!!
Fortunately it didn‚Äôt totally fail and still managed to hold the engine long enough for me to lower it back onto the bench. Less than a minute before this, I had my arm underneath the engine lining up some parts! A reminder to always be mindful of safety.
Another thing to watch for is damage to the object being lifted. When I switched to using chain, I found that a couple of tubes and plastic components got damaged when the weight of the engine pulled the chain tight against them. Thinking about it now, it would have been worth the time to make some kind of beam to hold the chain off the top of the engine ‚Äì next time.
Before I got to making the exhaust, I managed to get jobs done using a recipricating saw and a hack saw but for the exhaust there were so many cuts that wanted to be straight and ‚Äòaccurate‚Äô that I needed something better. Ideally I would have bought a band saw, but my limited budget pushed me to get a chop saw instead. It did save a bit of space but if I did it again, I‚Äôd hold out for a band saw.
I kept a fairly comprehensive record of everything I bought for the Fiero project, I‚Äôm sure that if I did another swap now, it would be very different. This list includes things like specialist tools, parts, services and everything I could think of that I spent money on for the project. It‚Äôs definitely not 100% accurate and I think I was quite lucky with the condition of my Fiero but it does give an idea of how it is possible to build a sports car on a very low budget. Prices are in $CDN and were incurred around 2006 ‚Äì 2010.

Last year, Tanqueray resurrected Tanqueray Malacca Gin, a product that it had killed almost a decade ago. It was a surprising move ‚Äì why would Diageo bring back an old, discontinued product for a small limited time release? When you look at the numbers for the gin category, it must have been an fairly difficult pitch by the Tanqueray team to get Diageo to greenlight the special limited release. If you just look at volume, gin doesn‚Äôt really seem like a blockbuster spirit. In 2013, total volume for the gin category was down a whopping 3.8% (source: DISCUS) with a 0.6% drop in gross revenue. Hardly compelling data, and on paper not nearly enough to justify investing significant money producing and distributing a limited release product.
It‚Äôs when you start to look at the broader picture of gin that the move begins to make more sense. Yes, general volume may have declined last year, but that drop was mostly at the very low end of the gin category, categorized as ‚Äúvalue gin‚Äù. These gins are the ones on the bottom shelf of liquor and grocery stores and often are sold in giant liter bottles rather than conventional 750ml. It was at this end of the category where the volume dropped the most (-6.9%), but that drop was offset by some significant growth in the high end gin space, which saw a 5% growth in volume and an impressive 6.3% growth in gross revenue. It turns out that people are drinking less ‚Äòbad‚Äô gin and drinking a lot more ‚Äògood‚Äô gin.
The real story of gin extends beyond the raw sales numbers. If you go to any craft cocktail bar in the world, odds are you‚Äôll see several classic gin drinks on the menu. In the 1800s, gin was an extremely popular spirit, and as such it was used as the base for many of the great classic cocktails, like the Martini, Negroni, Aviation, and Bijou. Gin has been a key element in the craft cocktail revolution and a spirit that many craft bartenders are passionate about. Part of this passion comes out of the sheer opportunity to change perceptions about gin in the United States.
For a number of reasons, gin has gotten an unfairly bad reputation in the United States, where you‚Äôre more likely to find people who say they hate gin than love it. This ‚Äúgin resistance‚Äù is fairly regionalized to the United States and seems to dramatically dissipate when you look toward other countries. Why is gin so beloved in the UK, Spain, and the rest of Europe while many Americans have put it on their ‚Äúdo not drink‚Äù list? The answer may be more about what gin is being mixed with than the quality or taste of the gin itself. In the United States, tonic water is a pale variation of the tonic in the rest of the world. The key reason is highly muted levels of quinine (the element that makes tonic bitter), as well as the use of high fructose corn syrup in many commercial tonics. High fructose corn syrup mixes horribly with gin and helps produce the off taste that many Americans have grown to dislike. The difference in taste and quality between US tonics and their European counterparts (even under the same brand name) is even more dramatic than that between Coke in the United States and Mexican Coke, which is made with pure cane sugar. Bad tonic, combined with a general lack of knowledge in using and handling vermouth in the US, have lead to a bevy of gin drinks that are worthy of US drinkers‚Äô disdain.
So how do you change the hearts and minds of American drinkers and get them to discover the magic spirit that is gin? Tanqueray‚Äôs answer is to get their products into the hands of the people who do the best job mixing gin into drinks that Americans will not only drink, but that they will downright crave. Tanqueray‚Äôs commitment to the craft cocktail revolution has been exceptional, and therein lies the answer to the question, why would a monster company like Diageo bother with a handful of cases of a long lost product? American craft bartenders asked Tanqueray to bring back Tanqueray Malacca, and Tanqueray listened. The move not only created more good will among craft bartenders with the brand, it also helped create some excitement for the category. This excitement also helped fuel a relaunch of Tanqueray‚Äôs iconic Tanqueray Ten Gin with a new look that tipped its hat to craft.
If there‚Äôs one model that major spirits companies tend to follow, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúIf it worked once, do it again‚Äù. While Tanqueray Malacca Gin may not have sold tens of thousands of cases, it did the job that was intended, so Diageo has opened up Charles Tanqueray‚Äôs legendary recipe book for another limited edition gin release. This time around, it‚Äôs Tanqueray Old Tom Gin.
Old Tom Gin is a style of gin that bridges the gap between Dutch Genever and London Dry Gin. At its core, Old Tom Gin has a weight, sweetness, and lushness that‚Äôs reminiscent of Genever but with a drier finish that‚Äôs more akin to a London Dry Gin. Old Tom Gin was an extremely popular style of gin during the heart of the classic cocktail heyday in the 1800s, and can be found in many key classic drink recipes like the Martinez and Tom Collins. Unfortunately, Old Tom Gin was one of many spirits which fell victim to Prohibition, and post-prohibition production of Old Tom petered out in the 1930‚Äôs and 40‚Äôs. It was considered a ‚Äúlost spirit‚Äù in the US until just a few years ago when cocktail historian David Wondrich helped encourage Ransom Spirits, a small Oregon distiller, to try to re-create the classic spirit.
Tanqueray Old Tom Gin (47.3% ABV / 94.6 proof, $32.99 per Liter) ‚Äì unlike Ransom Spirit‚Äôs Old Tom Gin, which was a recreation of Old Tom Gin, Tanqueray‚Äôs special Limited Edition release comes directly out of Charles Tanqueray‚Äôs famed recipe book, with notes on Old Tom Gin that date back to 1835. These notes and subsequent recipes were the basis for Tanqueray Master Distiller Tom Nichol to create this limited Old Tom Gin release for Tanqueray.
From the first nosing, it‚Äôs clear that Tanqueray‚Äôs Old Tom Gin is distinctly different from Tanqueray‚Äôs other gins. Juniper is definitely a lead note, but it‚Äôs accompanied by a distinct lushness that includes bright lime, almond, and orris root. The core of Tanqueray‚Äôs Old Tom Gin nose is sweet citrus (reminiscent of honey tangerine) supported by a layer of spice which includes juniper, black pepper, coriander, and licorice root. The entry is lush and sweet, two words you don‚Äôt expect to be associated with gin. The initial softness is amazing considering that this gin is 47.3% ABV; it‚Äôs perhaps one of the most sippable gins on the market. What‚Äôs remarkable is that the sweetness doesn‚Äôt seem to be coming from any added sugar. It would have been perfectly acceptable to add sugar to an Old Tom Gin, as many classic Old Toms were sweetened, but instead the sweetness is one of those great magical things that can happen in a spirit where it tastes sweet but isn‚Äôt sweetened.
The entry is all sweet lime and soft juniper. The way in which the juniper is presented here is so approachable, it‚Äôll make even the most ardent ginaphobe reconsider their take on the spirit. As we head towards the midpalate there‚Äôs a wonderful handoff between the lush, sweet opening and the full, round, spicy midpalate. In the midpalate the juniper ramps up and is joined by black pepper, coriander, licorice root, orris root, and a eucalyptus note. Even with all this spice, Tanqueray‚Äôs Old Tom Gin maintains the silky undercurrent of citrus sweetness established in the opening. The finish for Tanqueray‚Äôs Old Tom Gin is long and dry, solidly in line with the house style for Tanqueray.
One of the cornerstone‚Äôs of Tanqueray‚Äôs taste profile is balance, and it‚Äôs one of the things that Master Distiller Tom Nichol does best. Nichol manages to find balance in an Old Tom, something that‚Äôs nothing short of remarkable. While Tanqueray Old Tom Gin is being billed as a Limited Edition, it‚Äôs still a Diageo product, so for them ‚Äúlimited‚Äù means ‚Äúa hundred thousand bottles‚Äù. This is a hearty amount for something that‚Äôs limited, but that‚Äôs a good thing. Tanqueray‚Äôs Old Tom Gin is an important addition to the gin category. It‚Äôs an expertly crafted gin that sits side by side with Tanqueray London Dry and Tanqueray Ten in terms of quality and execution. We hope Tanqueray will consider adding both Old Tom and Malacca to the permanent Tanqueray line up.

Ham makes for a great party or holiday gathering main dish. However, it‚Äôs pretty much inevitable that you‚Äôre going to have some ham leftovers that you‚Äôre wondering how to use.
While you can easily freeze your ham to use within the next few months, you can also use it in a lot of dishes to change things up. Check out these 15 ways to use leftover ham.
1. Add it to your scrambled eggs or omelet for breakfast. I love a protein-packed breakfast of scrambled eggs with diced ham and a sprinkle of cheese.
2. Make hash. There‚Äôs just something warming about a hearty hash to start the day with, though I enjoy it for dinner, too.
Besides, what‚Äôs not to love about a mix of fried potatoes, ham, onions and whatever else your stomach desires?

I actually look forward to having a bone-in ham just to make this soup! Make sure you leave a little bit of meat on the bone and also some ham to add in.
7. Make a quiche or frittata. Quiche, which has a crust, and frittata, which does not have a crust, is the perfect dish to make when you‚Äôre trying to clean out the fridge.
You can add all sorts of meats, veggies, and cheese and it‚Äôs a great meal to start or end the day with. Using ham instead of sausage in our mini frittatas recipe would be delicious!

Instead of the same old ham and cheese, make a croissant sandwich, grilled ham and cheese, or even a Croque Monsieur.

One of my favorite ways to use leftover ham is to put it in my delicious overnight eggs benedict casserole complete with homemade hollandaise sauce.

10. Put it in scalloped potatoes. I love a scoop of rich cheesy scalloped potatoes with ham mixed in. Here‚Äôs my favorite recipe for cheesy scalloped potatoes.
11. Mac and cheese with ham. Turn mac and cheese from a tasty side dish to main dish star by adding in some diced ham.

Fresholi Bites: A Bit Of Catch Up!

Essential Oils there have been a few that have sneaked on over the past few weeks but the most recent one is Roman Chamomile (English). There has been a poor harvest so finding a good quality oil at a good price has been so incredibly difficult. The range is gradually growing and I have to say, although it can cause a headache or two, it is an absolute joy sourcing good quality essential oils as I have the opportunity to submerge myself in a world that I dearly love and am very passionate about.
Pure Absolutes Finding good quality essential oils is wonderful but oh.... you can only imagine the pleasure I have had finding pure absolutes. I am so very, very pleased with my finds, which include linen blossom, jasmine sambac, hyacinth and the most incredible frangipani with a most beautiful musky/powdery undertone that just lingers and lingers. All the absolutes are supplied in their purest forms.
I have also given the supplies area a bit of a facelift, which should help make navigating it a little more easy. Do have a look and see what you think. I have plans to introduce some new products very soon as well as increase choices in the ranges already available.

Bob tells his colonoscopy story. He says, "I had a really good experience with my doctors.... [everything was good] no polyps, no nothing, and they said don't come back for ten years. For anyone who is apprehensive about this, it's really not that bad at all."
‚ÄúThe beginnings of IAYPIC ‚Äì the Irish Association of Young People in Care began as far back as April 1995. The Childcare Committee of the Irish Association of Social Workers (IASW), which I chaired, brought together a group of young people in care alongside other agencies including the Irish Foster Care Association (IFCA) and the Children‚Äôs Legal Centre; and the ‚ÄòYoung People in Care Support Network‚Äô was established. This group faded away unfortunately after about six months due to lack of support. The following year, when the IASW was meeting with the Department of Health regarding the setting up of the Irish Social Services Inspectorate (which later became HIQA) the Department offered me an opportunity to bring a group of young people in care, into the Dept. of Health to give their own views on the setting up of the Inspectorate and the Care System overall. This took place in October 1996, and one of the priority items on the young peoples‚Äô agenda was to receive a commitment from the Dept. of Health to provide funding to set up a professionally run organisation to represent the voice of young people in care and care leavers. This group met again a few weeks later in an office in Focus Point (which later became Focus Ireland) and I believe that this was when we formally called themselves IAYPIC (following the Australian Organisation AAYPIC, and VOYPIC in Northern Ireland).
This was a very powerful way for the Department and the Health Boards to be seen as listening to the voice of children in care (good practice).
There were other formal and informal meetings with the Dept. of Health including with Frank Fahy ‚Äì TD who continued to be very supportive over the years, plus an important meeting with the Eastern Health Board (EHB) (at the request of the Dept. of Health) to get their backing. In March 1999 we were surprised to hear from the EHB that they were giving us a grant of ¬£50,000 (Irish Pounds). Our next surprise was when I discovered that it was very difficult to lodge ¬£50,000 due to banking regulations regarding money laundering! However, after formalising a contract with Barnardos to host IAYPIC throughout its set-up stage, the money was transferred to Barnardos. The Manager of Barnardos‚Äô Guardian ad Litem service at that time was tasked with supporting IAYPIC. Her first job was to manage the recruitment of a National Co-ordinator, and we were then very lucky to get Catherine Carty to come on board with all her commitment and hard work to establish IAYPIC on a firm footing‚Äù.

Vitamin E is a vital compound that is necessary for the human body to grow and develop normally. It is primarily responsible for its role in the metabolic processes within the body as well as its role in keeping the immune system strong. According to the National Institutes of Health ([NIH], 2016a), vitamin E occurs naturally in eight forms, including alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-tocopherol. Alpha-tocopherol, however, is the only form that is recognized as being able to meet the needs of humans.
Free radicals can cause a great deal of damage to the body, potentially contributing to the development of cardiovascular disease and cancer. As a fat-soluble antioxidant, vitamin E helps quell the formation of a particular type of the radicals, reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are formed by the body when it converts food to usable energy. Vitamin E limits the production of ROS in select circumstances, which researchers believe may potentially help prevent the onset of chronic diseases (NIH, 2016a).
The list of food sources of vitamin E is long and centers on nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables. Vegetable oils, such as soybean, safflower and sunflower, as well as nuts and seeds, like peanuts, peanut butter and sunflower seeds, are among the best sources (NIH, 2016b). Just one tablespoon of wheat germ oil, for example, contains 100 percent of the Daily Value for the vitamin ‚Äì or 20.3 milligrams. Other important sources of vitamin E include fortified cereals and leafy green vegetables; although, most Americans get the bulk of their vitamin E from sources such as vegetable oils like soybean, canola and corn (NIH, 2016a).
A deficiency in vitamin E among Americans is rare. When it does occur, it is often linked to other health conditions, such as diseases that make it difficult for the body to absorb fat. These conditions increase the need for vitamin E such that more of the nutrient must be ingested. Examples of these conditions include cystic fibrosis and Crohn‚Äôs disease.
Vitamin E supplements often contain amounts of this element that are far higher than the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA). As a result, people who take blood thinners and other types of medications could be harmed by taking supplemental vitamin E. Caution should be exercised and a physician's advice should be sought when considering taking supplements containing the vitamin (NIH, 2016b).
There are many foods that provide vitamin E and, as stated, most Americans face no potential deficiency of the vitamin. As such, we‚Äôve focused on recipes that provide not only this nutrient, but also those that contribute to a well-balanced and complete diet.
A brilliant way to start the day, this delectable pudding blends potent sources of vitamin E in the forms of almonds and sunflower seeds. It‚Äôs also a source of vitamin A and essential minerals like zinc and calcium!
Spirulina and spinach both supply a source of vitamin E in this scrumptious beverage which offers a tart taste and an abundance of other nutrients to make it a healthy choice for anytime.
Adding vitamin E to your diet is simple with these scrumptious snacks. Discover delicious sources of the nutrient with the recommendations from our registered dietitian below!
This scrumptious spread pairs well with any bread or cracker to supply an extra burst of flavor. In addition to providing a preponderance of protein and fiber- almonds are a rich source of vitamin E with each quarter-cup of the nuts supplying 34% of the Daily Value (DV) for the vitamin (NIH, 2016a).
Sunflower seeds provide a potent provision of vitamin E with 37% of the DV for the nutrient in each quarter-cup. These seeds have been prepared with a redolent tamari seasoning which features a flavor reminiscent of soy sauce (NIH, 2016a).
This piquant pairing of sweet and spicy flavors offers a palatable provision of fiber with 2 grams of the carbohydrate in each serving. The fruit also offer vitamin E in each spicy-hot helping, about 4 milligrams of vitamin E, per ounce.
Filberts are full of vitamin E with 4.3 milligrams in each ounce of the nuts, accounting for 22% of the DV for the nutrient. Our nuts have already had their shells removed to create an easy-to-eat snack ready right out of the bag. Try mixing them with almonds and other nuts for a blend of tastes and textures.
These scrumptious snacks supply a healthy alternative to traditional chocolate treats that are equally, if not more, delicious. The almonds inside provide both a crunchy texture and a rich source of nutrition, while the dark chocolate coating adds beneficial antioxidants to the mix.
Our honey roasted peanuts are supremely saccharine with a naturally sweet flavor that doesn‚Äôt overwhelm the sense, but pairs perfectly with the creamy, crunchy texture of the snack. Peanuts provide protein and contain 11% of the DV for vitamin E in every ounce (NIH, 2016a).
This super-seaweed does it all with ample amounts of iron in every serving. The potent powder can be easily added to smoothies for a post-workout provision of protein. The powder also offers a modest amount of vitamin E, along with nutrients that include omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin C, and calcium.
T or F? A common long-term goal may involve saving for collage for parents of a newborn child. True.
What is the Rule of 72? Allows you to divide your interest rate by 72 and find how long it takes for your investment to double.
The naked 180ft Cerne Abbas Giant ‚Äì thought to be thousands of years old ‚Äì is carved out in the chalk downs in North Dorset.
Women living near the carving have an average of three children in their lifetime ‚Äì a national record.
They are the highest birth-per female figures in Britain for more than 40 years.
Locals think the giant could be having an inspirational effect on couples in the area.
Nursery manager Katie Raine said the increasing number of children at the Archway Nursery in Pimperne ‚Äì which is in sight of the Giant ‚Äì were living proof of the findings.
‚ÄúWe can take 73 children in any one day and we‚Äôre absolutely chock-a-block,‚Äù she said.
The findings, from a survey of 10,000 North Dorset women aged between 15 and 44, placed the district at the top of the charts, leaving the London borough of Westminster at the bottom, with just 1.16 children per woman.
Samantha Beadman, deputy manager of Winterbournes Day Nursery in Winterbourne Kingston, said news of the area‚Äôs chart-topping fertility rate came as a surprise.
The new figures are based on research conducted last year. The findings showed a drop in the fertility rate for the first time since 2001.
Birth rates had been rising steadily since the millennium, reaching 1.97 per woman in 2008, from a base line of 1.65 in 2000.
North Dorset‚Äôs survey-topping fertility rate beats the highest recorded national average, when figures recorded in 1964 revealed women were likely to produce 2.93 children in a lifetime.
how long to approve PE application in Texas?
Hi, I understand this is the mailing address if I send my materials via USPS regular mail: Texas Board of Professional Engineers 1917 S Interstate 35, Austin, TX 78741-3702 But is the mailing address the same if I send via UPS, FedEx or USPS Express Mail? I thought express mails have to been sent to "a person" with a phone number, is that correct? Please advise! Thank you!
alright. finally i can get back to work. productivity has been very low today.
in 24 hours? the info from the board is so not reliable !!
so it's now in the board's hand to decide when to release .
i used the little chat with on NCEES website, and here is the reply: Elizabeth C.The results have already been released to the state boards. Some boards have already released to individuals. As soon as the state board where you took the exam gives permission to NCEES to post the results into your account, we will do so.
didn't someone mention that Texas was usually one of the first states to release results ?? any historical data to support ?

A blog from the video available on SAP Web IDE channel.
This is in continuation with my previous blog https://blogs.sap.com/2017/02/01/git-basics-in-sap-web-ide-understanding-git/ . Refer to this blog, if you are not aware of how to create a GIT repository.
Cherry Picking a Feature means to take a commit from some other branch, and playback in desired / current branch.
This is required, for instance, if bug is fixed in one branch and we may need it to bring to another branch.
1.Create a local branch. Call it a ‚ÄúFeature‚Äù branch.
2. Make any changes in Feature branch.
3.Create a file ‚ÄúCommonMethods.js‚Äù in util folder. Our Project Explorer and git pane should be somewhat like this.
4.Click on Stage All, write Commit Description and Commit.
5. Check master branch, there won‚Äôt be any util folder. See below.
6. Now we want to commit this change to our local branch. For now its ‚Äúmaster‚Äù. This will be known as cherry picking new feature to local branch. Cherry picking Feature Branch to Master branch.
Go to GIT history pane, then ‚ÄúFeature‚Äù branch. Select the branch. Click on Cherry-Pick.
Important : Make sure master branch is selected in GIT pane. As this is our local branch and we want new changes from feature branch to be reflected here.
After few seconds, desired commit will be cherry picked.
We are having util folder in our local branch now.
Now Push the changes of master branch to origin/master.
This is done with Cherry-Picking.
Please feel free to provide your queries/doubts/suggestions/corrections.
TFW there's an awkward silence.
Kourtney Kardashian had an awkward on-air moment Thursday morning when hosts of an Australian morning program asked how her sister Kim Kardashian is holding up after her robbery ordeal.
The questions was met with bizarre silence, while the reality TV star sat staring off camera, presumably listening to the panicked advice of her publicists.
Making matters worse, the connection was dropped. When producers got Kardashian back on the line post-ad break, she explained "we had a bad connection."
"I think she's totally blanking me on that question," said David Campbell, co-host of Today Extra, adding, "She could just say her sister is fine! I mean I think we just said that you know we're very concerned and we were onside and we hoped that everyone's fine, which I still do."
According to The Herald Sun, Kourtney insisted that she be re-connected to the show‚Äôs host in order to address the question. Once connected, she discussed how the Kardashian klan was feeling after her sister was held at gunpoint during the Paris robbery.
"I think we're all really still shaken up and I just ‚Äî you know, I think she has a big supportive family and I know that, like, all of the traumatic things that we've been through, you know, we get through them together as a family and that's what family is all about," she said.
While it might not be the most informative response ever uttered, it may have been worth it as an act of "saving face." What's a potential little white lie about a technical glitch between friends, anyway?
Many of us would love to use the old "we just had a bad connection" excuse to get out of conversations IRL, sometimes.
Abstract A new ionic liquid, PMIInCl4, was prepared by mixing 1-methyl-3-pentylimidazolium chloride (PMIC) with InCl3. The molar enthalpies of solution of PMIC and PMIInCl4 in water to form solutions at various molalities were determined at 298.15 K using an isoperibol calorimeter. Using Pitzer's electrolyte solution model, the molar enthalpies of solution of PMIC and PMIInCl4 at infinite dilution, Delta(sol) H-m(o), and Pitzer's ion-interaction parameters beta((0) L)(MX) beta(( 1)L)(MX) and C-MX(phi L), were derived. The values of the apparent relative molar enthalpy L-phi and relative partial molar enthalpy of the solutes (PMIC and PMIInCl4), (L) over bar (2),were subsequently calculated. Using the values of Delta(sol) H-m(o) of PMIC, PMIInCl4 and InCl3, the enthalpy change, Delta H-r = - 38.19 kJ . mol(-1), was calculated for the reaction PMIC + InCl3 --> PMIInCl4.

A City of Austin review of short-term or vacation rental homes, which began 18 months ago, soon spawned a version of what Council Member Bill Spelman jokingly called this week "the famous Austin stakeholder process," in which seemingly everyone gets a say.
Now, Spelman said, it is time to let numbers do the talking.
Spelman seeks to suspend the review so that the city auditor can determine how many short-term rentals exist, where they are located and their impact on neighborhoods. He said available data on short-term rentals is insufficient and conflicting.
Today, the council is scheduled to consider suspending the review, which sought to write new rules for the rentals that some have said are a nuisance in neighborhoods dominated by single-family homes. Others have passionately defended the rentals, saying they fill an important need, draw revenue to the city and have been unfairly depicted by opponents.
The review has involved various city departments, including the auditor's office, and led to a number of heavily attended and sometimes highly charged public meetings with owners of rental homes, neighbors and other interested parties.
In June, the city's Board of Adjustment ruled that home rentals for a period of less than 10 days violate city code. That triggered a lawsuit by five owners of rental homes, who said that, if upheld, the ruling would deprive them of constitutionally protected property rights.
City officials deferred enforcement while the review played out, drawing the ire of short-term rental opponents.
Russ Horton, the plaintiffs' attorney, said Wednesday that they are not moving forward with the case as long as the city does not attempt to enforce the board's ruling.
Spelman said he can't remember a more contentious issue.
"Rather than to rush putting an ordinance in the books, let's see if we can find some incontrovertible evidence to see how many (short-term rentals) there are and what are the effects they're having on the neighborhoods, and get a sense of what problems we're trying to solve here," Spelman said.
"We've got neighborhoods that say, 'This is one of the worst things that's ever happened, it's tearing our neighborhoods apart, destroying our quality of life,' and saying these things need to be eliminated," Spelman said. "On the other hand, we've got owners, the Board of Realtors, HomeAway (the Austin-based vacation home listings giant) and others saying, 'These are really good for neighborhoods, and we are improving the quality of life, and we need to keep them and encourage them.'"
Spelman's proposal, which is co-sponsored by Council Member Chris Riley, is drawing mixed reaction, including criticism from council members Kathie Tovo and Laura Morris on at a council work session Tuesday.
Tovo questioned whether information gained from a new study would be more helpful than that already collected from "probably hundreds of stakeholders."
"The concern that's been raised is that people didn't buy their homes to live next door to a hotel," Morrison told the American-Statesman on Wednesday. "This is a policy decision that has far-reaching implications for the sustainability of our neighborhoods."
Maurice Anderson, who lives across the street from a short-term rental home in Allandale, questioned why Spelman would want to "freeze" the process.
"The city's Board of Adjustment ruled last year that commercial short-term rentals are illegal. Why didn't Councilman Spelman and the city stop their proliferation back then?" Anderson said in an email. "If Councilman Spelman wants to freeze something, that's what he should be freezing."
But one of the founders of the Austin Rental Alliance, which represents more than 100 owners of short-term rental homes, said Spelman is proposing the right approach.
"Let's look at the facts and the figures and let's get the emotion out of this. That's a fair way to do it," said Bob Easter, who with his wife owns two short-term rentals and who helped form the rental alliance last year.
Easter, one of the plaintiffs who appealed the Board of Adjustment's ruling, said he hoped a new study would also look at the renters themselves, a group he said includes grandparents visiting for special occasions and families who want to be with loved ones who are in Austin for extended medical treatments.
"They're not the party types that everyone is saying," Easter said.
Spelman's proposal would ask the city auditor to distinguish short-term rentals where the homeowner occupies the home from those where the homeowner does not live in the home. It asks the auditor to compile the numbers of 311 and 911 calls and police and code compliance citations issued at short-term rental locations in 2011 and compare results with the number and types of citations for the neighborhood in general.
This wouldn't be the first time the auditor has looked into short-term rentals. Last year, the auditor's office explored hotel occupancy taxes paid by short-term rental owners but didn't attempt to count all short-term rentals in the city, City Auditor Ken Mory said.
Spelman's resolution asks the auditor to update the 2011 study, which found evidence that some short-term rental properties had not been identified by the city controller's office and were not paying hotel occupancy taxes.
Easter said his alliance requires that members pay hotel occupancy taxes.
In a memo to the City Council on Wednesday, Mory estimated that the work Spelman's resolution seeks would take three months to complete and cost about $63,500.
The relatively fast rise of short-term or vacation rental homes as a business model appeared to catch city officials off guard in 2010.
The code amendment review began after the city Planning Commission noted a rising number of complaints about the rental homes from people who live near them.

The market may very well rally to the 5 or 14SMA on the daily, then find resistance.
The only thing that will ease the volatility and give equity markets a sustained and stable move from current levels is if clarity from the EU is given. IMO, I would like to see something drastic, maybe devalue the Euro or get the Euro-bond in place by the end of the year. At this point, I will take anything, even if it gives the markets a short-term shock, to get this crap out of the way.
Because I am expecting some level of 'shock' from the EU action that needs to get done, I will always have a small level of SPY protection in play.
Today we speak with German mezzo-soprano Daniela Sindram, who appears as Dulcinea in our Sunday/Friday cast for Don Quixote. Sindram previously appeared in Seattle as Cherubino in the 2009 production of The Marriage of Figaro, and we ask her what it's like to play "pants roles," as well as what she thinks about French opera and Dulcinea's character.
Last time you were in Seattle, you played a boy. This time, your character of Dulcinea is very much a woman! Do you prefer one type of role over the other?
I do not prefer one type of role over the other. But, in fact, I sing more pants roles than female parts, though the female parts are becoming more numerous, especially because my voice is developing more and more to the female Wagner parts. So I will sing my first Fricka (in Rheingold and Walk√ºre) this year and next year my first Venus in Tannh√§user. What parts I also really would LOVE to do are Italian parts like Santuzza (Cavalleria rusticana) or Eboli (Don Carlos). But still I love singing and playing boys and I have colossal fun on stage trying over and over again to make the audience forget that there is a woman only pretending to be a young man.
Daniela Sindram (seated in the center) as Cherubino in 2009's Marriage of Figaro. Also pictured, standing from left to right, is Christine Brandes as Susanna, Ted Schmitz as Basilio, and Mariusz Kwiecien as Count Almaviva.
You‚Äôve performed more Italian and German operas than French ones. What are the challenges specific to singing in French, as you do in Don Quixote?
For me, personally, the language itself is a big challenge because I never learned conversational French. That means much more preparation work for me, including how to pronounce and understand each word that you are singing and that others sing, so that you are able to interact. This process is way slower and more intense.
Nevertheless, I love the French language and singing in French. I think this language has something sensual and is easier to sing than, for instance, German. I also think the French music invites‚Äîeven demands‚Äîyou to connect your emotions directly with the music.
Nicolas Cavallier (Don Quixote) and Daniela Sindram (Dulcinea) in the Sunday/Friday cast of Don Quixote.
Is Dulcinea making the right choice by refusing Don Quixote? She says her destiny is to give her love away‚Äîwhat do you think of her outlook on life and romance?
Dulcinea finally comes to know Don Quixote as a noble and pure soul, and she realizes that she‚Äôs disclaimed a loveable man. But she also understands that she could never be even close to the ideal that Don Quixote formed in his dream world. So this seems to be the only choice she can make.
Her outlook on life and romance? I don‚Äôt think she believes that love can bring happiness, but maybe now that she knows Don Quixote she has a slight idea of what she‚Äôs really been yearning for and maybe it will open her up to real love‚Ä¶.
Here in America, there‚Äôs a stereotype of German productions as being very avant-garde. As someone who sings in Germany a lot, do you think this is true?
That's true. German productions are often avant-garde and unconventional. And sometimes you really can spend a very exciting and fantastic evening in the opera and see pieces from a different perspective. But it also often happens to me that I'm leaving a performance with a big question mark on my face, and I feel overstrained, trying to understand the deeper sense of that new interpretation. But there is a big audience in Germany that demands a new point of view from a director, though there‚Äôs also the audience that wants to see a recognizable piece (though maybe with modern staging). So we do have both there: modern and traditional productions.
Daniela Sindram (Dulcinea), with principal dancer Ra√∫l Salcedo, in Don Quixote.
Don Quixote premiered in 1910. Do you ever get the opportunity to perform music even newer than that?
Oh, yes, I regularly do ‚Äúnew‚Äùmusic. Last November I did a production of The Turn of the Screw by Britten (first performed 1954). In the last few years I also sang the part of Sophie in Sophie's Choice by Nicholas Maw which was performed in 2002 for the first time. I also did a piece‚ÄîDeutsches St√ºck mit Hamlet from 1998‚Äîcomposed by Wolfgang Rihm, a living German composer. I had the opportunity to meet Nicholas Maw and Wolfgang Rihm in person, but I‚Äôve never had the chance to meet a composer while working on a piece, or to create a new role, which I would love to do. I recently started singing modern songs from different composers and right now I have some unpublished songs from Detlev Glanert (also a living German composer) that I'm looking forward to performing in the future.

Making So isn‚Äôt something to be dismissed ‚Äî the choice is critical to your site‚Äôs achievement, though. After allyour website‚Äôs theme will decide the design displayed to your customers, and your plugins will include most of its plugins.
To help You make an educated decision, I will be taking an in-depth look at a few of the top places to purchase WordPress plugins and themes: MyThemeShop. As well as analyzing MyThemeShop in general, I‚Äôll also be looking in its most important features, reviewing some of its top products and sharing hints for prospective buyers.
Using a Title like MyThemeShop, you‚Äôd think the answer would be clear cut. In fact, MyThemeShop occupies a middle ground between a WordPress theme store and a WordPress‚Äôbar‚Äô. Because of its pricing policy, more leans .
This is Because although all of its products (MyThemeShop develops themes and plugins) are readily available to purchase individually, it also includes a membership option that gives users complete access to its whole product range.
As we have Touched during this post, MyThemeShop offers quality, 24/7 support for many of its customers. So that other users may learn from issues, it takes place primarily in its own support forum.
There is a Dedicated section for themes and plugins, plus separation between superior and free products. Simply post your problem about the forum and one of the MyThemeShop-employed service staff will respond typically .
Rather Than focusing on paid associates, MyThemeShop delivers great support to free users as well, believing that the service someone receives for a commodity shouldn‚Äôt rely on whether they paid or not.
The forum Additionally supports a search function, which means that you may look to a problem the fastest way to discover answers. Inquiries that were resolved are indicated with a postage that was green solved.
Along with The service forum, MyThemeShop has added a collection of 45 video tutorials teaching the basics of WordPress, how to use the MyThemeShop goods, as well as how to use some favorite non-MyThemeShop plugins. These videos are accessible via the Tutorial tab.
And, if You‚Äôre still not able after posting to the support forum to fix your issue, MyThemeShop also provides support. Should you require tweaks to your theme, specific customisations, website setup, or website migrations, the MyThemeShop support team will be able to assist you out (though these services are, as you would expect, paid).
Now, on To the important stuff: its products‚Äô quality and choice. We‚Äôll begin by studying MyThemeShop‚Äôs core product range: WordPress themes.
MyThemeShop Themes were created with usability in mind, and each motif ships using a market-leading motif options panel from which you are able to control the theme‚Äôs settings, import arbitrary content (to get your website looking like the demo you watched when you purchased the motif ), or dip into its many customisation choices.
For a Begin, each motif has support for colors that are unlimited and the entire catalog of Google net fonts ‚Äî over 600. Maybe more importantly, all themes offer unlimited background options: such as a variety of built-in background layouts, the aforementioned unlimited colors, and also the option to upload a custom background image.
The Themes are fairly feature-rich too. There‚Äôs built in advertising management, buttons that were stylish and lightweight, and contact form performance included with each theme. All topics come with support for the entire selection of MyThemeShop shortcodes, letting you incorporate eye-catching design elements to your website easily.
Most Importantly, though, is that this is a clean, lightweight, and robust code underneath all. What‚Äôs more, to ensure that your website is as visitor-friendly as you possibly can, all topics boast a fully mobile responsive layout, lightning-quick load times, and cross-browser compatibility.
Another Bonus: each theme has a narrated video tutorial, also MyThemeShop offers round-the-clock support that will assist you out of any tight spots you might experience (more about this later).
All Themes include a preview to help you get an concept of the plan. These previews come in rows of three by default, but, if you‚Äôd like a slightly larger preview, you can pick rows of two. There‚Äôs also a filter which allows you form the themes by popularity or release date.
When You have found a motif you like the appearance of, you could click through to the motif‚Äôs product page. Here, you are going to be able to read more about the theme‚Äôs main attributes, plus you will find an notion of the subject‚Äôs popularity ‚Äî every theme includes a community rating from five.
Before You buy a theme, I would strongly recommend spending a few minutes researching this demonstration. You‚Äôll be able to sample the motif‚Äôs layouts, try out different customisation options, and find a general idea of how the theme looks and performs.
From Social media to the search engines, Schema is a site tailored for dominating the SERPs ‚Äî achieved by a carefully designed, SEO-optimized layout. The subject is also fast, with website speed an important ranking element. The website uses a stylish-yet-simple layout, also it comes packaged with inspection performance and advertising management. For an SEO-focused theme named Schema, the motif, of course, adds the necessary Schema markup which powers Google wealthy snippets.
Social Traffic is consistently growing, and sites have popped up feeding off societal traffic. If you are searching to construct a viral social website, SociallyViral was built for you ‚Äî that the motif boasts many different features to Boost social shares and also cater to viral traffic. That means a site with a great deal of societal buttons, trending article widgets, and, with one eye on monetization, advanced AdSense optimization.
OnePage supports a stunning full-screen slider over The fold, catching traffic‚Äô attentions immediately. It‚Äôs largely a company theme, supporting dedicated staff, portfolio, customer, testimonials, and pricing segments ‚Äî all of which look extremely professional and extend trendy parallax effects. The theme also looks great when kitted out in its alternative blogging skin.
PointPro is just another stylish, professional motif, this Time coming in three variations ‚Äî shop, blog, and business. The company template is particularly eye-catching, using a tidy, organized layout complementing lots of pictures ‚Äî there is an image slider, thumbnails, and gallery functionality, too. The motif gives you loads of versatility, with wallpapers that are unlimited colors, and custom sidebars.
You can Search for plugins in precisely the same way as topics, however, because plugins vary in regard to their capabilities, the plugin pages are the areas.
Each Plugin page has a very long list of the plugin‚Äôs features, providing you with a clear indication of what it can (or can not ) do. You will also see a user evaluation, and there is a useful presentation for every plugin so you can see each one in action.
Since There are fewer plugins compared to themes, let‚Äôs run down the three MyThemeShop WordPress plugins. I supply a succinct summary of what each plugin can do.
WP Mega Menus adds beautiful, interactive menus into your website. The menus that are mega arrive allow you to add images, and packed with choices. These menus are a prominent and stunning design feature for your site, plus they make it simple to navigate.
WP Subscribe Pro enables you to exhibit stylish popups and Subscription boxes to cultivate your list. This plugin boasts lots of design options to play , and support for exit intent technology. You can even incorporate WP Subscribe Pro such as MailChimp, AWeber and, needless to say, together with the email marketing autoresponder services.
MyThemeShop Functions a flat pricing structure ‚Äî any theme will set you back a predetermined $59, with plugins. This is a typical price for plugins and themes, and on a par with major marketplaces like CodeCanyon and ThemeForest.
Should you Want access an membership account costs $167 annually. You‚Äôll get access to client support and 20 plugins, as well as most of 99 themes and full access.
Membership Is more expensive than that of some of the other motif clubs, like ElegantThemes (from $59 a year), TeslaThemes (from $59 a year), and ThemeIsle (from $99 a year), but more affordable than the likes of WooThemes (from $399 a year ‚Äî update ‚Äî 16th July: WooThemes.com is currently under the umbrella of WooCommerce.com, with their themes available at https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/), WPMU Dev (from $294 a year), and StudioPress (from $499 annually ).
What is More, an membership will also give you access to some products released by MyThemeShop to the length of your subscription.
Overall, MyThemeShop is among the WordPress clubs round ‚Äî it delivers an impressive range. Throw in an excellent, flexible selection of plugins and support that is ongoing, and it is not hard to see why more than 300,000 customers have taken the plunge and become MyThemeShop customers.
Should you Construct lots of sites ‚Äî perhaps as a creative service or a freelance programmer ‚Äî then the club membership is sure to be the most appealing option. This package will give you access to impress your customers, and each one comes loaded with customisation options so you can tailor a site to a client‚Äôs liking.
The Yearly membership reflects the best value, and more than holds its own when compared for 20 specialist plugins and 99 quality topics is an absolute steal!
I‚Äôve been wanting to share this shoot for so long, because it‚Äôs such a fond memory and also because I just ADORE the images from it.
So last year, I spent the day with Dominique Bader Photography, creating a simple dinner party set up for her guests that evening. We made mince pies, had a glorious cake from The Floury and a lot of fun. AND right now I‚Äôm here to give you a few tips on designing your winter table but if you‚Äôd like further tips on having a stress-free Christmas then head on over to Rock My Style for our feature. You‚Äôll also read below my simple mince pie recipe which I follow yearly. It‚Äôs not only something I love to do as it gets me in the spirit but it‚Äôs also RIDICULOUSLY easy.
1 | When you want to put together a quick dinner party styling for winter time, foliage is your friend. Things like ivy or branches you can forage from your own garden or local forest are great options. Make sure you don‚Äôt steal from someones home if you don‚Äôt know them!! OR pop to a flower shop and pick up a few stems of something branch like to lay along the table. There‚Äôll be a lot of twig like options right now. Try and stay away from anything glittery!
2 | Declutter. The key to a table lay is it being functional and intentional in it‚Äôs beauty. The table is set for people to sit at, drink, eat and chat at. You don‚Äôt want too many fussy items that can be knocked over or detract from the function of the dinner party. Simple is always best.
3 | Add candle light! With our shorter days you‚Äôll most likely be dining in the darker hours. You can buy beautiful frosted pillar candles to add texture and beautiful lighting to your table. The candles sit beautifully in-between branches laid through the centre, they also take a while to burn so you won‚Äôt need to worry about them running out if dinner goes on for a bit longer as well as you can use them over and over again!
4 | A fabric runner adds movement and softness to a table design. It also gives context to the design of the centre of the table. Even if you want to have a table cloth, consider a simple piece of fabric to bring attention to the centre.
5 | Your normal crockery will be perfect, don‚Äôt worry about fancy plates. Consider laying your larger plates down to act as a charger for the rest of your meals.
7 | Consider adding a scented candle to add to the evenings senses. Neom are great for truly perfuming a space!
A great online shop to purchase beautiful decor items. I love their pillar and shaped candles which work great for a dinner party. Don‚Äôt forget some glass plates to catch any melting wax.
I love adding coasters under water glasses, it might sound silly but I feel it gives the glass grounding and adds to a table setting. A considered thought has gone into using a beautiful marble coaster. These coasters are my favourite and always used at dinner parties. They work for any style of event and work through spring, summer right until winter.
Pop on down to your local fabric shop to get a cut of around 3m of a chiffon or crepe to use for your table. It‚Äôs a quick an cheap alternative to buying a linen however it will have it‚Äôs raw cut edges, something to note! Or if you want to invest in something totally special and to be used multiple times, I recommend a gorgeous cotton runner from Kate Cullen, a stunning choice and she has hand-dyed to the most perfect shades.
This place offers up beautiful and inexpensive options for cake stands and display platters for your food.
1. You want to place the flour and butter together in a bowl and rub together to create a crumb consistency. Then add the sugar and 1 egg and mix together to make a sticky dough.
2. Tip the ingredients out onto a lightly floured surface and fold until it comes together to create a firm dough. Wrap it in cling film and pop in the fridge to cool for about 10minutes.
Pop your oven on to 220C/200C for fan assisted ovens or Gas 7.
4. Roll out your pastry to 3mm thickness and begin cutting the shapes. I use a textured round cutter to create the base, usually with a scalloped edge. You should be able to cut around 12 with left over pastry.
5. Remember to grease your cupcake tin then pop your circular pastry bases in, pressing lightly. Tablespoon your mincemeat into the base and brush the edges with your whisked egg.
7. Bake your mince pies for 15 to 20minutes ‚Äì I usually find 15minutes is enough! then take them out to cool before picking them out of the tray.
8. Finally dust with icing sugar!
The moment I realised I loved teaching was the minute I began speaking at my very first Instashoot workshop at Tanya‚Äôs Cafe in London. I had a small group of 9 small businesses from all walks of life sit around a table together, amongst gorgeous flowers, their flower cat ears in place all ready to work through the exercise book I‚Äôd poured all of my learnings into. That adrenaline kicked in and I felt energised and joyful discussing Instagram with these peers and inspiring women sat around me.
After a year of successful workshops I began receiving emails on how other solo-preneurs were too far to attend and sad to miss out on the in-person teachings. I didn‚Äôt initially consider writing an online course because of the beauty of in-person teaching, I‚Äôm a sponge, i love to soak up energy and talk to my students. I wanted to hear their stories, talk through their struggles and truly connect with them however my writing bug got the better of me this year and I decided to try my hand at writing some of what I taught.
I did worry that if I wrote an online course it would eliminate the beauty of my in-person workshops but over time as my workshops have developed I‚Äôve realised they, too, have become more than there were originally set out to do. At my latest one at Millbridge Court, I made the decision that all future workshops will only have a maximum of 6 students, reducing from my original class size of 10. The reason behind that is to get more talking happen, get more community spirit building and so I have even MORE time individually with each student rather than darting around at the end to try and have in-depth conversations with everyone.
At my workshops, I made friends, I cried and I spoke so honestly about my own growth that the room felt like a space of friends rather than industry peers. I am so honoured to have taught intimately over 40 students since beginning the workshops and hope to continue to do so many more, however I‚Äôm hoping that this online course is going to offer up the same warmth that my in-person students receive. I truly spoke from the heart in this course.
One thing you may have already figured out about me, I absolutely adore writing. From instagram to fictional stories, I have such a passion for putting pen to paper (or finger tips to screen) and scribbling away all my thoughts, words and dreams. Whilst I‚Äôm not the best at language and I make a whole load of spelling errors, I adore this way of communicating with my audience and even in my workshops. That is how I developed the Instashoot Workbook.
When I began to write my teachings for this online course, the words seemed to just happen, whilst I had a stressful time figuring out the entire structure (I‚Äôm a perfectionist and want everything completed yesterday), I soon began to feel that this course was much more than just Instagram styling but a story of my businesses growth, how I gained my following, how I grew my client book, why I did what I did back then and where work takes me now. Never had I looked at my timeline of my story before but I‚Äôve put it out there for you in this course, so you can literally see, step by step, how I came to where I am now.
Whilst I‚Äôm no millionaire (and have no ambition to be) I am the happiest I have ever been when I first decided after university that I wanted to work within weddings. I found my calling finally and found my voice.
Now, let me do the same for you. I‚Äôd love you to read more about the course, what is included and all the details you‚Äôll want to know.
I S A L L A B O U T !
Optometry has to take the lead with glaucoma, especially with recent advancements.
1. Diagnose it sooner. With new OCT modalities, we can diagnose the disease sooner than ever and begin treatment earlier. However, ODs must use this technology with caution and be sure to have a firm grasp on the data provided. We have to understand what we are looking at with the deceptively simple red, yellow and green charts to avoid over- or under-diagnosing glaucoma.
Other new diagnostics can help as well. Corneal hysteresis may predict visual field loss progression and can play a role in deciding when to treat and in setting treatment expectations. And someday, 24-hour home monitoring of IOP may completely transform our management strategies.
2. Understand the disease better. While we don‚Äôt fully understand what causes glaucoma, we know IOP is a risk factor, as is corneal thickness and hysteresis, family history, age, race, high myopia, systemic conditions, previous trauma and chronic inflammation. Knowing the cause will one day allow us to treat the disease more effectively. One theory suggests it‚Äôs caused by an imbalance between IOP inside the eye and intracranial pressure (ICP) around the optic nerve, affecting the eye‚Äôs metabolic needs.1 For example, patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension have a bowing of their optic nerve, and 50% of astronauts develop vision loss because their cerebral spinal fluid increases disproportionately higher than their IOP, resulting in a hyperopic shift and optic nerve edema.1 So the key ratio may be IOP minus ICP‚Äînot just elevated IOP.
3. Rethink surgery. The introduction of minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS) has forever changed glaucoma treatment. We must be ready to help manage patient compliance, understand the options for those on maximum therapy and properly educate and refer patients with both glaucoma and cataracts. Invasive surgeries such as trabeculectomy will go by the wayside, making room for a greater combination of MIGS, laser procedures such as SLT, and next-generation pharmaceuticals.
5. Treat the ocular surface. Optometrists can‚Äôt forget the impact of glaucoma therapies on the ocular surface. Staining, blurred vision, irritation or dryness from chronic meds can cause patients to decrease or even discontinue their use. Something as simple as managing the ocular surface may improve compliance and, ultimately, outcomes.
Glaucoma is a condition that affects all of our practices, and these five elements may well dictate the future of disease management, our understanding and innovations in patient care.

Can someone please help me out on this. We are doing a POC of the new Ifolder 3.8 server and 3.8 client to replace the older Ifolder. One thing that we have seen is that client on a machine would just at some point will stop uploading files. I have machine A B and C. On machine C, if I create a new file, Ifolder would not recognize that there was file that was created and in turn never upload it to the server. While this is happening on machine C, I could go to Machine A, create a new file it would upload the file to the server and machine B and interestingly Machine C would also download the file and sync it with the server. Machine C will still never upload that file I created before. Exiting and restarting Ifolder would solve the issue. Anyone out there seen this?

1. Set up your green screen background for your videos. You can use a professional green screen, a Party City or similar green tablecloth, green bulletin board paper, a green sheet or a pizza box tabletop green screen with green Starbucks straws to support small props. Be creative and experiment with color and lighting to get the best possible video.
2. Record your videos with the green screen as a background using your basic iPad camera app. If you are creating multiple projects at the same time you may want to set up multiple albums in your photo app. One album for each project will help keep you organized. When ALL of the videos have been recorded, it is time for the third step.
3. Choose your background photo or video. You can use the iPad camera app to take a background photo or video or import a picture from the internet. Imagine the possibilities: outer space, maps, historical places, under the sea, gardens, national landmarks, etc.
4. Open up the Do Ink app and look for the import areas at the bottom of the screen. Add your background photo or video to the bottom row. Add your first video to the middle row. After adding the first video, slide it over to allow the second video to be added (use the red line as a guide). Go ahead and follow that process, adding and sliding, until all of your videos have been imported on the same line. Watch this tutorial for further instruction.
5. Save your video to the camera roll, and then email it or upload it to YouTube, Facebook, or Vimeo. Then hare the link on Twitter or email to parents.
For Kindergarten, I read the book Leaf Man and had the kids design their own leaf man. They wrote one sentence to tell the direction their leaf will fly (north, south, east, or west) and what it will fly over (a house, school, field, bridge, or something similar). I then used the pizza box table-top green screen with green Starbucks straws to complete this project. I simply taped their leaf to the green straw and the kids took over, reading their sentence and making their leaf dance across the green screen. After I added a background video of a small creek, their leaves then danced above the creek!
First Graders read the book, The Great Kapok Tree. The kids chose an animal from the story, conducted research on PebbleGo and wrote one or two favorite facts. I printed small versions of their animals and used a table-top green screen (pizza box) and green Starbucks straws. Each child read their facts while moving their animal around using the green straw. I used the green screen app to add the kapok tree as the background.
Second graders created commercials for their economics unit, advertising a specific good or service. They worked together to write a script, and we used green screen technology to put them into an actual location.
Third graders became meteorologists. Each student chose a location in the world using this website. They researched the weather, wrote a script and became a meteorologist for the day. I recorded each child in front of the green screen and used the Do Ink app to add different backgrounds for each child. The kids loved watching each other report the weather in their actual places.
See some of these projects here.

What 'wounded warriors' need to know about securing disability benefits | Alverson + O'Brien, P.C.
It‚Äôs extremely important for those brave men and women who suffered some manner of disabling injury while serving in our nation‚Äôs armed forces to understand that they may be entitled to more than just the benefits available through the Department of Veterans Affairs. Indeed, they may also be able to secure benefits via the Social Security Disability Insurance program.
The SSDI program is structured in such a manner that these ‚Äúwounded warriors‚Äù can receive expedited processing of their disability claims from Social Security Administration staff.
As to which armed forces personnel are eligible for this expedited processing, the SSA offers it to any service member who became disabled while on active duty anytime on or after October 1, 2001, irrespective of location.
The medical condition must have lasted or be expected to last for a minimum of one year, or result in death.
One question that service members inevitably have is whether they are able to receive benefits for a prior disability if their health has since improved.
The good news is that receiving disability benefits for a closed period is a possibility.
However, the determination as to whether the service member qualifies for a closed period of disability is contingent upon whether the medical condition meets the SSA‚Äôs disability definition, whether it was filed within a designated window and several other factors.
We‚Äôll examine these factors in our next post.
Regardless of whether you served in the military, if you have questions about disability benefits, please consider speaking with an experienced legal professional as soon as possible.

Suppression of renin and aldosterone by small amounts of DOCA in normal man.
Previous investigators have suggested that low renin hypertension may be due to an unknown mineralocorticoid. This investigation was designed to simulate the effect of an unknown mineralocorticoid by administration of small amounts of desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) in three normal subjects. The response of 2-h upright plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PA), and urinary aldosterone excretion (UA), as well as extracellular fluid volume, (ECFV) was determined on a high and low salt diet before and during the administration of DOCA for 13 days. After 9 days of DOCA, ECFV increased approximately 2 liters and PRA decreased to levels found in our patients with LRH. PA and UA decreased appropriately as PRA was suppressed. We would expect an unknown mineralocorticoid to have similar effects on the reninangiotension-aldosterone system. Thus, these results would suggest that in LRH the normal levels of PA and UA are inappropriately elevated in relation to the low PRA.
The campaign designated funds to the center to enhance the services provided.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, CA ‚Äì November 9, 2017 ‚Äì French Hospital Medical Center (FHMC), a Dignity Health Central Coast hospital, is pleased to announce the collaboration with the Grover Beach Police Department, the Grover Beach Police Officers‚Äô Association, and Cuesta College Safety Services to raise funds for FHMC‚Äôs Hearst Cancer Resource Center. The Pink Patch Project, a collaborative cancer awareness campaign originally conceptualized in Los Angeles, raised a total of $8,075 during the first annual fundraiser in October.
Each organization sold commemorative pink patches for $10 each to their respective officers, to be worn on the arm of their uniforms during the month of October, which is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The partnership was initiated to raise funds for the Hearst Cancer Resource Center, which will help further the research, treatment and care of those battling cancer and their family members.
The Pink Patch Project generates awareness about breast cancer, the most common cancer and the second leading cause of death for women in the United States. While most people are aware of breast cancer, this campaign educates the public about the early detection and prevention of cancer. The collective efforts of public safety agencies throughout the nation through these efforts yielded a tremendous amount of support from many communities.
The Hearst Cancer Resource Center wellness and support services provide a bridge between standard medical care and a full range of healing therapies. The integrative approach offers a foundation for care that includes an array of programs designed to strengthen the body, educate the mind, and alleviate the stress which often comes with a cancer diagnosis.

Anesthesia and analgesia for labor.
Epidural analgesia remains the mainstay for providing pain relief during labor. The search continues to find the ideal combination of analgesic agents and administration techniques that will provide excellent pain relief for the mother yet minimize side effects to the mother and fetus. This article reviews recent studies of epidural analgesia, including the increased use of epidural opioids, patient-controlled epidural analgesia, and the complications of epidural analgesia (including effects on gastric emptying, maternal temperature control, and hemodynamic changes to the mother and fetus). Intrathecal (spinal) analgesia, especially using opioids, is also discussed.

We are excited that we will be traveling to Prichard, Alabama, again this summer! This will be our seventh year serving with Light of the Village at their summer Bible camps. Camp activities include Bible study, games, music, sports, skits, crafts and more, but the real highlight is investing in and developing relationships with the children Light of the Village serves. This trip is an incredible opportunity for our students to see God at work and to take part in His mission by serving and loving His people. We spend our days in Alabama serving; then at night we come together for a daily recap, worship and a time of devotion.
Sunday, June 16, we will attend the 9:15 BP service and the beginning of the 11 o‚Äôclock service, then head for ‚ÄòBama after a quick lunch that is provided. We will travel to Prichard in a charter bus. Time spent traveling is sometimes when the greatest bonds are formed as a team. We‚Äôll stop in Tallahassee for dinner and arrive at Government Street Baptist Church in Mobile around 9 p.m. We will arrive back in Tampa the evening of Saturday, June 22.
If you are interested in going, please email Sharon@stfchurch.com for an application. The application will be reviewed by our Student Ministry Team, and you should hear back from them no later than 1 week after you submit your application.
of the farmers from Ukkalgaon village of Shrirampur block. By analyzing the problem and reasons behind it, the KVK made an effort by providing a suitable solution of rakshak traps for effective management of fruit flies in water melon. Rakshak traps are the pheromone traps which are useful for mass trapping of the male adults of fruit flies. By installing three rakshak traps per acre immediately after fruit setting can effectively manage fruit fly infestation in water melon.Initially KVK undertook the awareness programmes in the form of trainings and group discussion regarding effective management of pests and diseases in water melon and major focus was given towards fruit fly management. The farmers were made aware of rakshak traps as an effective tool for ontrolling fruit flies in water melon. For popularizing this concept among the farmers, the KVK undertook the frontline demonstration on use of rakshak traps against fruit flies at 30 different locations in Ukkalgaon village.
The farmers were asked to install 3 rakshak traps per acre after one month of crop growth stage and change the Bacu lure after 30 days. These traps help in mass trapping of male fruit flies and thereby minimize it‚Äôs population in the field. The method demonstration on installation of rakshak trap and placing of Bacu lure in this trap was also conducted on the field. The farmers were asked to take daily observations about the catches obtained in these traps up to one week.
KVK supported this technology through supply of rakshak traps and Bacu lures from KVK farmer‚Äôs service center and thus it helped in spreading of this technology in different parts of the district. Thus the timely and quality supply of this input at reasonable rate has also resulted in increasing the adoption of this technology.
With the participation of the farmers the group action took place in Ukkalgaon village for installation of rakshak traps with Bacu lures because there was considerable area under water melon with polythene mulch. The large number of catches of male fruit flies was observed during first 5-6 days and after that the catches were minimized.. This resulted in less egg laying of the pest and thus the incidence of the pest was under check. It helped to convince the water melon growers regarding the efficacy of rakshak traps for fruit fly management.
The efforts made by KVK in this direction resulted in wide spread adoption of the technology. The technology also spread in the neighboring villages and more number of farmers started to approach KVK for supply of these traps. By observing the effectiveness of rakshak traps, some of the vegetable and fruit growers in the district purchased these traps in bulk quantities from the service center of the KVK and started to use it against fruit flies in cucurbits as well as fruit crops. More than 3000 rakshak traps have been supplied by the KVK through it‚Äôs farmer‚Äôs service center and the technology has been adopted by more than 200 vegetable and fruit growers in the district covering 325 ha. area during last two years. The concept has now become the regular practice among all the water melon and musk melon growers from the KVK operational areas. By seeing this result, State Agricultural Department also conducted the block demonstration of rakshak traps in water melon on large scale under the funds of ATMA.
Driving shouldn‚Äôt be taking lightly. Not only are you responsible for your own life on the road, but also supposed to look out for pedestrians and fellow drivers as a good citizen. If you do not give your complete attention to your steering wheel, there is a chance that you might cause accidents on the road that can end disastrously for you.
In Australia, drivers tend to be distracted by other matters when they are on the road. They divide their attention between the steering wheel and everything else which places them in imminent danger without them realising it. A landmark study was carried out with the help of in-car footage to understand this situation. The footage was captured over thousands of trips after a group of motorists agreed to become a part of the study.
The findings left the researchers worried about the condition of roads. One of the participants in the study was Ann Williamson who is a road-safety analyst. She volunteered to make a contribution and let her driving habits to be captured on camera.
She was taken aback by the results. According to her, many things end up becoming obstacles to driving if one thinks about it.
Monash University, located in Melbourne, began the interesting study through their Accident Research Centre. The drivers were filmed for almost 2 million kilometres throughout the study.
Professor Jude Charlton, who is the head of the centre, found that a large number of drivers find it difficult actually to focus on the road ahead when driving. They spend 45% of their time behind the wheel doing unrelated things. That means that they engage in a secondary activity after every 93 seconds of driving.
How are drivers distracted? Moreover, what can be done about it?
Whenever one thinks of distractions when driving, the first thing that comes to mind is the use of mobile phones. However, it turns out there are other activities too which can cause drivers to take their eyes off the road. They are unable to concentrate on driving when they are taking a bite, adjusting dashboard controls, touching up their appearance or engaging in conversation with other people in the car.
The diversity of activities is a cause of concern because people do not realise that these small things add up to a massive distraction overall. Drivers do not even understand that they are unfocused, and that is when the worst of accidents take place.
According to Professor Williamson, drivers need to figure out their priorities before they can drive a vehicle on a public road. It is not impossible for them to do two tasks at a time, but the main emphasis should be on driving carefully.
The analysis of distractions when driving was an offshoot of a massive study of in-car behaviour that is ongoing. Professor Raphael Grzebieta, a chief investigator for the Australian Naturalistic Driving Study, states that they want to study Australian drivers in different conditions.

I love this sauce! It is good on just about everything. My favorite is on tacos, on Taco Night.
New product for us - very good.
I was an early adopter of this FABULOUS hot sauce. The hot version (not mild or extra hot) is our go to hot sauce. It is great with fish and chicken and has a unique savory quality. It's not overly salty like some hot sauces, and adds to almost anything you could want to spice up. I use it a lot in cooking to just give some warmth and flavor to any number of dishes.
Easily one of my favorite hot sauces.
Tis the best, great product, service, will try more soon!
It is not very spicy for my tastes, but does have a little amount of bite that comes slowly. It is a sauce and would be great on tacos or something where you want a less thick sauce. Very neat taste- will buy again!
This is perfect with Salmon. It is like it was made it. It is also very good with eggs. It ry to keep a couple bottles on hand.
This stuff is great with chicken. If you want something quick, grill some slices of chicken in a little olive oil, brown, take off the heat and pour in the peri peri. Don't inhale..! Mmmmm Good Stuff!
Something about the Peri Peri sauce is so tasty, I'm glad I was able to find it in a three pack! I'm sure it will be used up soon!
I have been into hot sauces my entire life.The 3 Peri Peri sauces from South Africa are my all-time favorite.Great flavor and 3 seperate heat levels to choose from! I highly recommend everyone try them!
Has decent flavor but majorly lacks heat. Had to use quite a bit to get the desired flavor. It is actually about as hot as tabasco sauce.
I'd recommend the hotter version of this sauce. The mild is too bland.

African Rhino Peri-Peri Hot Sauce is tasty. The "hot" version has as much flavor as it has burn. great with burritos. Good, civilized heat for a meal.

I've decided what I want to be when I grow up. A stay-at-home-crafter. It's all I've been able to think about since this summer. There are too many things I want to make or attempt to make, and there isn't any time to do it in! To make this idea more appealing to Tom, I threw in the idea of also growing all of our own veggies and made the mistake of saying, "I'll even milk goats." In case you don't know Tom too well, he has a dream about living in the country somewhere on a goat farm. While he's not milking his goats, he'll be at our road-side-veggie-stand selling our homemade jellies, veggies, and crafts that our 12 kids made, under my supervision of course.
Washing water in which the washing cloth has been boiled. Dilute with equal parts cold water before using.You could also use one of the several brand of sanitary wipes.
Maybe. Just maybe one day I can be a stay-at-home crafter-mom-veggie-gardener-goat-milker.
Everyday when my students walk into class they have some sort of a journal or sentences to correct. Today the sentence was about how ice cream was patented by Italo Marchiony in 1903.
Well, the student came in and said, "Did that guy really patent ice cream?"
Me: "yes, I believe he did."
This made me laugh so hard! My husband and I have been tinkering with the idea of moving a few miles away to have land for gardening, tree climbing, and a bit of free-range roaming. We have a child at a Waldorf school (very organic) and have several friends who have their own chickens, goats, gardens, etc. But then I think of the work involved in gardening and goat-milking...I feel tired and go take a nap.
I would like to share an article written by a recent guest on my show, Terry Beatley who is the founder of No Excuse Ministry PAC.
This is in response to the letter to the editor of the Freelance Star Newspaper, with the title ‚ÄúThink you have control over your own body, ladies?‚Äù [Feb. 6]. I would like to share a counterpoint from Dr. Bernard Nathanson, co-founder of NARAL, America‚Äôs largest abortion lobby group. On Dec. 1, 2009, I flew to New York to interview Dr. Nathanson, who felt personally responsible for killing 75,000 children while he advanced unfettered abortion in the 1970s, and gave me a message to carry to America. I promised him I would carry his message and never stop.
The author of the letter, asked: ‚ÄúHow is forcing [a pregnant woman] to carry a baby to term with a serious deformity going to help anyone?‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo you think you have autonomy over your own body?‚Äù She voiced her complaint that Del. Mark Cole was patron of a bill that would repeal taxpayer funding of the state‚Äôs Medicaid program for women who choose to kill their babies in the womb due to physical deformity or mental deficiency. The author saw nothing positive or good in bringing a baby like this to full-term.
Dr. Nathanson had answers to these questions; if I could share them with the author over a cup of coffee, this is what I would say.
As I entered Dr. Nathanson‚Äôs apartment that December day, I observed a feeble man in his 80s. Too shaky to stand to his feet, he welcomed me to sit beside him while I asked my questions. I listened intently, sometimes with tears in my eyes, as his story unfolded. His decisions affected the course of American history and the lives of millions of Americans.
In 1969, with the help of a public relations firm, Dr. Nathanson and a few other people caught the nation by surprise and framed the debate over legalizing‚Äìor, rather, decriminalizing‚Äìabortion. The co-founders of NARAL invented the slogans of ‚Äúfreedom of choice‚Äù and ‚Äúwomen must have control over their own bodies.‚Äù Framing the debate away from the morality‚Äìor immorality‚Äìof killing another person, he and his team set out on a course to change public opinion and lay the groundwork for Roe v. Wade.
To gain the public‚Äôs acceptance of decriminalized abortion, he and his colleagues fabricated poll results, making it appear that the majority of Americans wanted legalized abortion, and disseminated this information to the media. In addition, they lied about the number of illegal abortions performed annually in the U.S., consistently citing 1 million abortions a year when only about 100,000 were being performed.
The co-founder of NARAL also explained how they marketed the idea that legalizing abortion would not increase the overall number of abortions‚Äìa claim that is now preposterous considering that a million people a year lose their lives to abortion. Reflecting on the sinister nature of the death industry, it was obvious he was remorseful for partaking in this national deception.
Four years after co-founding the nation‚Äôs largest pro-abortion lobby group, Dr. Nathanson saw the error of his ways and became pro-life. With the help of the new and improved ultrasound and electronic fetal heart monitoring, a second patient was revealed: a baby, a baby with a beating heart, puckering his lips, stretching his little arms.
Shattering his pro-abortion world, founded on lies and deception, Dr. Nathanson turned from being pro-abortion and began to tell the truth. He even made an in-utero film called ‚ÄúSilent Scream,‚Äù which shows an abortion taking place. Revealing a baby squirming away from the suction tube, a little mouth open in an inaudible cry, ‚ÄúSilent Scream‚Äù was seen and ‚Äúheard‚Äù around the country.
Dr. Nathanson knew what we all really know in our hearts: The baby is not the woman‚Äôs body. Therein is the lie that the co-founder of NARAL started. Once we recognize the humanity of the baby, who temporarily lives inside his mother, the argument, not the baby, is dead. Regardless of how deformed or ugly, he or she has the gift of life, and every life is precious. No child‚Äôs life should be taken. A woman can do what she wants with her body, but the baby living inside her is a separate and genetically distinct human being with every right to live.
When a nation and a government violate this principle of life, everyone‚Äôs rights are abrogated. The same lie supported slavery; the same lie undergirded the Holocaust the notion that someone is less than human.
As his hands trembled while reaching for a cup of water, I was thankful that since 1973 his life had been put to good use, proclaiming a message of life and love, not death and deception. He died on Feb. 21, 2011, but his message will never stop. Loving babies and protecting the gift of life, no matter how short or difficult, are the right things to do.
When America can do that again, everyone‚Äôs right to life is protected and the ‚Äúworth‚Äù of someone‚Äôs life will never be measured by somebody else‚Äôs scale. This protects the individual‚Äôs right to life and benefits society as a whole.
D.F. ‚Äì Thanks for sharing your comments. Experience can change a person‚Äôs view on life and it‚Äôs choices. Sometimes you wake up and realize the truth, not everyone is weak minded and easily ‚Äúduped‚Äù. I thought abortion was fine until after having several the concequences caught up with me. No one told me it was wrong, it was my own guilt and remorse that did so. It took me years to heal. some women never reach healing and spend years in depression and torment over their abortion choice. Today, there are so many other options ‚Äì there are so many wonderful families waiting to love and nurture a child and it isnt as difficult to be a birth mother.
How can you say ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt difficult being a birth mother‚Äù? What if you are 12 years old and your stepfather has sexually abused you? What if your life is in danger and giving birth could kill you and the baby? What if you have no money, no job, and children who need you right now?
Maybe I should have said that it isnt as difficult now, compared to 30 years ago, being a birth mother. Many agencies will assist you with medical and practical needs if you decide on adoption. Life is life and all is valuable to me ‚Äì Look at Steve Jobs, he was adopted, Tim Tebow was supposed to be aborted for health reasons. God is in control of the universe, he is the giver of life. Many of my friends have children with handicaps, one so severe that she was cofined to bed for most of her life, but her existence formed a family built around support and service to others.
This story reminds me of some of Norma Mccorvy‚Äôs statements after she changed her thoughts on abortion. She was basically duped by some lawyers to get the legal battle for abortion on track and later felt guilty for the death of MILLIONS of unborn.

Well‚Ä¶most of the time. The transactions I‚Äôve been involved with, for the most part, included a buyer and seller who welcomed the closing of escrow. Let‚Äôs just say some had a higher sense of relief than others.
Take Kent and John for example, we‚Äôve been walking through the sale of Kent‚Äôs office building to John in part 1 and part 2. This was mostly a straight-forward escrow with a timeline of 75 days. It would have been less, but John‚Äôs lender had a last minute report they needed which added two weeks.
There was also a credit John requested from Kent of $15,000 for an old boiler with asbestos insulation that needed to be removed after closing. This was not known until John performed his inspections. This did not add to the length of the escrow timeline, but was rather a slight detour.
Let‚Äôs use a train locomotive, railroad tracks and operating personnel as a metaphor to describe this entire process.
The purchase agreement is the railroad track that must be followed. The timeline, who is responsible for certain costs and is also responsible for certain tasks is included. It is all laid-out in front of us once the purchase agreement is ratified.
The escrow is the train locomotive. The escrow officer is the conductor‚Äìthe one who makes sure the train gets safely where it needs to go. The brokers act as the engineers orchestrating everything to reach the final destination while the buyer and seller are the trainmasters from whom we take direction.
The inspectors, contractors, lender, appraiser, title officer, etc. are all just along for the ride, but are essential in one way or another.
Oftentimes, we may need to hit the railroad switch and take a slight detour, but ultimately we must follow the path set by the purchase agreement.
Keeping with the railroad metaphor, trains have waybills while escrows have estimated closing statements and final closing statements.
There is a statement for the buyer and one for the seller. Each have a description, debit and credit column. The statement is an accounting, line-by-line, of the financial-side of a transaction.
Remember the $15,000 credit from seller to the buyer? This would show as a debit on the seller‚Äôs statement and a credit on the buyer‚Äôs.
You will find several debits and credits on each statement with the bottom line of each equaling the purchase price. This is basically double-entry accounting.
Other line items could be: loan amount, commission, inspection report cost, title insurance, prorated property taxes, loan fees, etc.
Escrows can be complicated that is why I treat my escrow officers kindly because they help make my job smoother and more efficient.

President Donald Trump pauses as he gives his first State of the Union address in the House chamber of the U.S. Capitol to a joint session of Congress Tuesday, in Washington, as Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan applaud.
Trump‚Äôs State of the Union address blended self-congratulation and calls for optimism amid a growing economy with dark warnings about deadly gangs, the scourge of drugs and violent immigrants living in the United States illegally. He cast the debate over immigration as a battle between heroes and villains, praising the work of an immigration agent who arrested more than 100 gang members and saluting the families of two alleged gang victims.
Country Characteristics and the Choice of the Exchange Rate Regime: Are Mini-skirts Followed by Maxis?
We use a sample of 140 countries to study empirically how a country's characteristics are associated with its choice of an exchange rate regime. When countries are classified according to their current exchange rate arrangements, we observe that small countries with low diversification of exports are the most likely candidates to peg their exchange rates. Other country characteristics, such as the level of development, openness of the real or financial sector, geographical diversification of exports, and fluctuations in the terms of trade, have hardly any power to explain the choice of an exchange rate system. Somewhat surprisingly, it is developing countries which have moved towards more flexible exchange rate practices during the last ten years, while countries with well diversified exports have adopted more rigid exchange rate arrangements. The regression results predict that Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom should have floating exchange rates, while Israel, New Zealand and Switzerland should adopt a more rigid exchange rate regime. Finland should adopt a regime of limited flexibility (such as the EMS) rather than peg to a basket or float.

NAACCR receives de-identified resident cancer case information from member registries across the US and Canada. With the permission of submitting registries, NAACCR combines the incidence data from registries that meet all NAACCR requirements for completeness and quality into a single comprehensive data file. This file, called the CiNA Deluxe Analytic File, is available to NAACCR members who are interested in using the data for cancer surveillance research and to NAACCR Committees/Subcommittees for approved analyses. Researchers may request access to the CiNA Deluxe Analytic File by submitting an application to NAACCR.
Applications are accepted any time and reviewed by the Research Application Review (RApR) Workgroup during its monthly conference call.
If, when proposing to analyze CiNA data, researchers select a single state or province as the research subject, the work group will request that the PI first contact the state or province central cancer registry for authorization to obtain their data for the proposed study. The work group will require direct authorization from the subject registry before the application will be considered.
Research proposals, all documents that accompany proposals, and communications about proposals are confidential. The volunteers who constitute the NAACCR Research Application and Review Workgroup (RApR) will maintain confidentiality of all documents related to CiNA requests.
The list below identifies the variables that are available in the file. Review the list to determine if the file contains the data necessary for your analysis.
Develop a working knowledge of cancer surveillance methods and an understanding of the data coding schemes used for your proposed study period.
Thoroughly review the Information for CiNA Deluxe Data Investigators.
Review and understand the CiNA Deluxe inclusion criteria, which central registries are included in the file, and the years for which data from each registry are included in the CiNA Deluxe data file.
If you are not a NAACCR member, contact a NAACCR member registry or other member organization and discuss your proposal idea to determine if it is feasible based on available CiNA Deluxe data. The principal investigator for any CiNA Deluxe application must be a NAACCR member. Researchers who are not NAACCR members may serve as co-investigators and/or apply for individual membership.

Cecily. This is no time for wearing the shallow mask of manners. When I see a spade I call it a spade. Gwendolen. [Satirically.] I am glad to say that I have never seen a spade. It is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different.
A man whose desire is to be something separate from himself, to be a member of Parliament, or a successful grocer, or a prominent solicitor, or a judge, or something equally tedious, invariably succeeds in being what he wants to be. That is his punishment. Those who want a mask have to wear it.

Violence in the name of religion can have no place in this country. India cannot and should not turn into a Nazi Germany, Pakistan or Arabistan.
Religious riots must be controlled with utmost severity. Reasons for the riots must be enquired into impartially. It is understood that the root cause was the demand of converted Christians to be declared as SCs/STs.
Demand for Relegation to backward castes has been the bane of our populist democracy. Politicians have been dividing the people into castes and more castes for votes. This must stop immediately.
I N ORISSA, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has ordered a judicial inquiry into the violence against Christian institutions. At the same time State Minister of Steel and Mines, Padmanabha Behera, has resigned owning ‚Äúmoral responsibility‚Äù for the Christmas carnage. These actions were taken after a curfew and after the presence of paramilitary forces proved to be no deterrents to the criminal elements who continued on their hate campaign. The minister‚Äôs resignation was one of the demands of the tribals in the district, who were opposing a proposal to grant Dalits the status of a Scheduled Caste. This hadn‚Äôt much to do with the attacks directly. So, the issuance of caveats by all parties to not ‚Äúmake this a political issue‚Äù rings hollow.
If this is not politics, nothing is. The state response leaves much to be desired.
ommunal vandalism and violence have been played out with almost meticulous precision. It is incomprehensible how 15 churches and in stitutes were targeted while there was no intelligence on the ground about any such activity Or did the state machinery . simply not bother?
Communal tension has festered in Orissa for years. One of its worst manifestations was the 1999 Graham Staines case, where the Australian missionary was burnt to death along with his two young sons.
While the murders shocked the nation, the case ended finally with a judgment that exposed the wide chasm between a deterring penalty and the ground realities. While the lower court sentenced the main perpetrator, Dara Singh, to death and 12 others to life imprisonment in September 2003, the Orissa High Court ended up commuting Singh‚Äôs death to life sentence and acquitted 11 of the others. The gap in the severity of the penalty , slashed to mere tokenism, cannot have sent the right signals to those inciting such hate crimes.
And clearly little has , been done to address the basic welfare issues involved in such communal divides. This is a politically-motivated crime and the upkeep of law and order is an issue that the state machinery alone can address.
Yet, the moves have been tactical and little is yet being done to grapple with the ground reality that Orissa may be becoming a cesspit of intolerance.
The rot must be stemmed now, Mr Patnaik‚Äôs reassurances notwithstanding.

No April‚Äôs Fool: Artlet Time!
Where did March go? Before I knew it the month was drawing to an end it was time to photograph the 31 Artlets, my way of journaling each morning. After challenging myself with words in January and the color Red in February I decided it was time to include some fabric into the Artlet journey.
While fondling the various stacks of hand-dyed and commercial fabrics I have accumulated over the past 12 years I settled on black and white. At first I didn‚Äôt expect to have enough prints to feature one for each day in March, however this was not the case‚Ä¶ I vaguely remember a time where I was mesmerized by the black and white section in quilt shops I visited. This was an advantage as I selected the stack of black, white and grey collection and affixed these securely to the card stock with PVA glue.
Soon I realized that I was bored with the high contrast. The solution was to add a splash of color whenever I felt like it or the morning was particularly grey. The results are visible in the slide show.
Initially I intended to add stitch and possibly even create mini-quilt blocks but soon I realized that activities like these would take up more than the 15 minutes designated to each Artlet. While stitches are a form of mark making I chose to add marks by moving felt tip markers and pencil crayons over the fabric instead of employing a needle and thread.
Enjoy the slide show and mark May 1st on your calendar if you are following the Artlet Journey! What will I explore next? I have an idea but you will have to wait till May to find out what I am exploring next.

Thought of you this past weekend and shared your Arlet idea with a lady who was doing a journal in stitches. She had the fabric rolled onto a piece of wood/dowling. Each day since January she has stitched something significant from that day. Her area per day is about two by six inches. Word spread quickly and she had to do show and tell numerous times. So creative.
Options to journal on a small scale are everywhere! I know knitters who knit one row a year with a color reflecting the mood of the day‚Ä¶ I wish there were more hours in a day to embrace all the wonderful ideas coming me way!
What a delightful collection. These March artlets have been particularly inspiring in their diversity,visual stimulation, and colour features you have added. I can really appreciate now, the value of making fabric artlets as a mini record of fabrics that have appealed to one at a given point in time and can enjoy again even many years later. Thank you Anna.
These were a lot of fun ‚Äì but as you notice‚Ä¶ I needed to add color to most of these! The grey weather in March and B/W fabrics was not well matched. As always ‚Äì a little color adds life!
You had me fooled but only for a minute, I thought that you had sketched all those pictures and you were becoming more unreachable. What a relief to see that they were fabrics. So beautiful. I will keep pressing on in my creations.
Unreachable??? Never ‚Äì for me it‚Äôs all about sharing not trying to outdo someone!
Remember ‚Äì the personal challenge I have set for myself is not to spend more than 15 minutes on each Artlet! Stay creative, Shirley!
Thanks for your feedback, Anara!
Amazing work! What fun with black and white a few pens and pencils. I can see where adding quilting would add so much more time. Love them just the way there are.
Thanks, Linda‚Ä¶. I put my creative cap on and am working on something totally different‚Ä¶ watch for May 1st!
I love the Artlets challenge! I had 4 of the same fabrics in my stash waiting for some artful project to come out of my mind!!!!
Really enjoyed your fabric slide show. That one that looks like a stack of lumber is so architecturally interesting!
Renewable Japan Co Ltd and Tokyu Land Corp will build a 62.7MW solar power plant in Kesennuma City, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan.
The company had a ground-breaking ceremony March 16, 2018. The plant is scheduled to be completed in March 2020.
About 196,000 solar panels will be installed on land owned by the city. The plant is expected to generate about 58,400,000kWh of electricity, which is equivalent to the amount consumed by 12,500 households, per year.
I read this great article and found it very interesting, thought it might be something for you. The article is called Renewable Japan Begins Construction of 62MW Solar Plant in Miyagi and is located at https://grendz.com/pin/6567/.

Jordanian protesters chant slogans against corruption during a March 15 anti-government demonstration in Amman. Jordanians have held Arab Spring-inspired protests since 2011, demanding political reforms and anti-corruption measures. The protests have been peaceful.
Across the turbulent Middle East, Arab revolts have toppled dictators and strongmen. Jordan remains stable for now but the pressure is mounting.
The Syrian war rages right next door, sending a flood of refugees across the border that has strained every resource in the kingdom.
Jordan shares the region's troubles: a faltering economy; rampant unemployment, especially among the young; and a popular demand for a say in how the country is governed.
"Jordan is stable, but you feel what is so unstable," says Labib Kamhawi, describing the contradictions. He is the head of the National Front for Reform, a coalition of political groups and civil society organizations. "The decision-making process is without any input from the people."
Jordan didn't escape Arab Spring protests. When it started in January 2011, demonstrators had some of the same demands as Syria's protest movement next door. But Jordan was different. Protesters stopped short of calling for the downfall of King Abdullah, the boyish-looking monarch educated in the U.S. and Britain.
Syrian refugees at Zaatari refugee camp in the Jordanian city of Mafraq, near the border with Syria, on April 25. The massive influx of refugees fleeing fighting in neighboring Syria is straining the Jordanian system.
And Jordan's security service was relatively restrained, handing out cold water and juice to protesters in a region where riot police regularly use clubs and guns to crush dissent.
"Violence and blood spilling in the region led to catastrophes," observes Ali Shukri, a retired general and former adviser at the royal palace.
The protest movement is smaller now, but the grievances have not gone away.
High-level corruption is the biggest complaint, says Kamhawi. In the latest scandal, a relative of the king fled to London after a parliamentary investigation into corruption charges. He is just one more official skimming millions, complains Kamhawi, as Jordan survives on foreign aid.
"People feel that this country is taken for a ride by a small group of people," Kamhawi says, and the economic ride for Jordanians is increasingly bumpy.
Jordanians want a bigger say in how the country is run, says Kamhawi. There are elections, but the king can dissolve Parliament and can hire and fire the prime minister.
The king has fired five prime ministers in the past three years. The government recently announced a dramatic rise in electricity prices, which could spark large protests again. But Jordan's political opposition remains fragmented, says Kamhawi.
"There is no alternative to the king and the monarchy," he says.
Jordan's King Abdullah, in the poster on the right, is shown next to his late father, King Hussein. Posters such as these reinforce the idea of continuity in a time of change.
Stability trumps concerns over the economy these days. The tensions are clear in Mafraq, a dusty town 40 miles from the Syrian border.
"We can hear daily, from midnight to 3 a.m., the constant barrage of bombings," says Amer al-Dughmi, who heads the tax office in Mafraq. "We even see the lights and the flashes from those explosions."
Mafraq lives with Syria's war every day, swamped by rebels and refugees.
The population there has more than doubled. As the town filled with Syrians, some Jordanians rented out their chicken coops and rooftops to refugees. International aid agencies picked up the inflated tab, complains the tax collector, driving prices out of reach for the locals.
"You basically now have a total breakdown of the economic model that we had before," he says.
Local marriages have been delayed because newlyweds can't find affordable housing. Refugees work longer hours for lower wages than the local residents.
Merchants complain that refugees hurt local business by selling food and tents they get for free from international aid workers. Jordanians are convinced Syrians have crowded them out of the local hospital as the caseload has more than tripled in two years.
At the local hospital, the administrator, Dr. Samir al-Mashakbey, points out that Jordan is one of the most "water poor" countries in the world. Jordanians are now complaining loudly, he says, because of the pressure on the system.
Still, Jordanians are grateful that they have not suffered from the violence they see in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere in the region.
Many Jordanians are now more hesitant to knock the Jordanian monarchy, says Ramzy Mardini, an analyst with the Jamestown Foundation.
"I think Syria has been a gift in disguise for King Abdullah," he says.
Mardini, based in Jordan, says regional violence and chaos have taken the steam out of Jordan's protest movement.
"Do they want stability or democracy? It's made that choice very clear," he says. "I think it's actually made Abdullah more secure in his position rather than less secure."
On billboards across Jordan, Abdullah's face beams down on his subjects. He is often pictured with his father, King Hussein, and his teenage son, a message of continuity in a chaotic time.
At a dinner party in an upscale neighborhood in the hills outside Amman, the guests say that at least Jordan is safe.
Naser Tahboub is the host for the meal. A professor, he is a member of the faculty at Jordan University's School of International Studies. The guests include some of his students, and his niece, May Tahboub, an architectural engineer.
The discussion is all politics: Should Jordan intervene in Syria? The overwhelming consensus is to stay out. Then the discussion turns to Jordan's protest movement and demands for wider democracy.
"It is definitely the case that the mood in Jordan has changed," declares Tahboub, the political science professor. His voice rises as he argues that Jordanians have lost confidence in a movement, he believes, that wants too much too soon.
"Are those who are on the extreme, demonstrating, some of them at least, can they deliver, can they do a better job?" he asks his students. "There is a great deal of skepticism."
Niece May speaks for a younger generation. She asks if Jordan can be stable, really safe, as long as Jordanians have no say in how the country is governed. But the threat from Syria and across other borders has changed even her calculations.
"We backed up, not because we are against striking or talking out loud," she says. "We don't know what to do."

Kennesaw State University President Dan Papp will retire from his position leading the school on June 30.
Papp announced his retirement in a letter to the Kennesaw State community Tuesday night.
‚ÄúIt has been a pleasure to serve as president of this great University for the past 10 years, and to enjoy a 43-year career with the University System of Georgia,‚Äù Papp said in the letter.
Papp says he informed system Chancellor Hank Huckaby of his retirement on Tuesday. The announcement comes as Kennesaw State is celebrating two days of commencement ceremonies for spring graduates.
During his tenure at Kennesaw State, Papp oversaw the consolidation of the university with the former Southern Polytechnic State University in Marietta. That consolidation has increased Kennesaw State‚Äôs enrollment to more than 33,000 students, making it one of the largest institutions in the state.
More information regarding an interim president will be announced in the coming weeks, Papp said.

On Tuesday night I went to dinner with the bf as he is heading off to America for a few weeks. We decided on Din Tai Fung for a few reasons 1. we have been saying to come for a long time and I had talked it up considerably after going a few years ago 2. the smaller version of the restaurant has opened in the new Westfield Sydney which has been great but we needed the full menu experience 3. I am completely obsessed with dumplings atm 4. I am even more obsessed with noodle soups that have dumplings in them.
For a Tuesday night the place was extremely busy and there was a fair few people outside waiting for a table. We put our name on the list and got given a copy of them menu to fill out and a buzzer to notify us when our table was ready. While we wait we grab a seat at the window outside and watch the chefs making the dumpling wrappers and filling them. The process seems extremely fiddly but the dumplings look oh so pretty, like little flowers. We waited for about 20mins for our table, by then we had chosen what we wanted and were seated at one of the large banquette like tables with the spinning lazy susan in the middle. It was a bit awkward sitting at a table with four other groups of people, especially when I kept pulling my camera out to get a shot. I had an urge to stand up and get better angled shots but I think I might have distracted all of the others a little too much.
Really love how pretty and perfect each of the dumplings are, and from making my own dumplings before I know how fiddly it is to get that shape.
We also ordered 6 pieces of the vegetable & pork jiao zi. Having the vegetables in the mixture makes the overall dumpling a bit drier in taste with a bit more crunch to each bite. I guess this type don‚Äôt have a broth in them either.
We had to order a dish with noodles as I remember them being really good and I have a feeling they also hand make them there, but I could be wrong. We went for a shrimp and pork wonton noodle soup. I added a few spoons of the chilli oil and bam..I was in heaven. On a cold day you cant go past one of these soups to warm you up. The wontons inside are also folded into a perfect round shape with the shrimp and pork flavour going well with each other, and providing a meatier taste.
Being all dumplinged out we started on the Taiwanese style black pepper steak which instantly became a favourite in my books. They surely were not shy with the pepper and it really did burn your whole mouth after a few bites. The steak was extremely tender and infused with the pepper flavour. The dish also came with an assortment of vegetables that had also been stir fried in the pepper marinade.
Lastly from the savoury menu we ordered the vegetarian rice fried with egg. The rice was light and not drowned in oil. You could choose other rice options with shrimps or meat but we decided to go with the plain choice so that it wouldn‚Äôt overtake the flavour of the steak and make the dish too heavy.
Nothing beats the end of a meal with some black sesame ice cream. I originally thought this was a mainly Japanese style dessert but I believe I could be wrong. The colour of the ice cream is not the most appealing, but what it lacks in looks it surely makes up in its sweet and nutty flavour. The ice cream was served with crushed black sesame; this gave it a crunchier texture which I prefer.
The ball is filled with black sesame paste with the outside being like a doughy bread mixture, very similar to the outside of a steamed pork bun (I‚Äôm guessing they are the same).
The service is very attentive; with staff covering your jacket on the back of your seat to make sure nothing is spilled onto it. The food came out pretty fast but in no set order so we received the rice and meat dish before the dumplings. It was a bit weird sharing a table with all these other people, but we got over that factor pretty quickly, and since it was just the two of us it was still easy to have a conversation. All up we paid just under $80 for the meal and were extremely full afterwards and happy that we got to try a variety of items from the menu. I will definitely be back again, and just from seeing how packed the place was on a Tuesday night you can tell that it is definitely one of the better Asian style restaurants in the city.

mmm i love dtf and the soup dumplings are just awesome!

In 2008 a study conducted at the University of Illinois studied the interaction of 2 diets (high protein, reduced carbohydrates vs low protein, high carbohydrates) with exercise on body composition and blood lipids in women during weight loss.
A cold-processed protein powder that also contains plenty of Branched Chain Amino Acids particularly Leucine is what you want to look for so that you can benefit from the lean muscle growth, increased metabolism, and accelerated fat loss. Make sure it is cold-processed protein because many cheaperprotein powdersuse heat in their processing methods. What this does is damage the fragile protein molecule and make the protein molecule less active and functional. Essentially you get protein that is not as effective as it could be.
It‚Äôs recommended that we eat 6-10 fruits and vegetables a day. Here in the States it is reported the actual average of fruits and veggies eaten each day is just 2.
Be sure to use these tips and comment below with some of your own tips.
One of the best ways to improve your body composition is by increasing lean muscle tone. When it comes to increasing muscle tone resistance exercise is the undisputed king.
It‚Äôs well-known that people who challenge their bodies with resistance exercises have more muscle than those who only use light weights and easy exercises. And, depending on the diet and other daily activities, these people often have less body fat.Challenging resistance exercises improves your body composition by stimulating muscle protein synthesis pathways and enhancing fat oxidation (burning) for several hours after your exercise session has completed.
Scientific studies have shown us that certain foods can enhance the amount of fat burned for energy several hours after the weight lifting session is over, and increase the amount of muscle synthesized.
Specifically, whey protein has been shown in many different scientific studies to increase muscle protein synthesis when take both before and after heavy resistance exercise. The best time to take whey protein for this effect is within 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after.
Recently, researchers from Michigan State University showed that when a whey protein supplement was taken before a heavy weight lifting session, resting energy expenditure (REE) was significantly elevated for 24 hours compared to a carbohydrate-only supplement.
REE is an important measure of the amount of calories you burn in one day and accounts for about 60-75% of your total daily energy expenditure. Thus, if you have a higher REE, you will burn more calories in the day and store less of them as body fat.
The whey protein supplement delivered important amino acids to muscle tissue during the exercise session which were used to enhance muscle protein synthesis for several hours after the exercises were over. These amino acids help speed muscle recovery and prevent excessive muscle soreness so you can lift heavy and hard again the next day.
Overall, if you‚Äôre looking to increase the amount of calories you burn after resistance exercise, which helps you build more muscle and lose more body fat, whey protein is the right way to fuel your body post-workout. Take whey protein within 30 minutes before and after exercise for the best effect and watch those fat cells run away in fear.

At the outset of WWII, Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued a statement that ‚ÄúAll combatants, under no circumstances undertake bombardment from the air of civilian populations.‚Äù US commanders, particularly General Frank Akers, believed that the best use of US air assets was precision bombing (as close as it got during the day) of specific military industrial targets. The British, however, felt differently about crossing the moral threshold of attacking noncombatants. British Air commander Arthur Harris said, ‚ÄúThe Nazis began this war under the rather silly notion that they were going to bomb everyone else and nobody was going to bomb them. At Rotterdam, Warsaw, London and a hundred other places, they put that rather na√Øve notion into use. They sewed the wind, and now they shall reap the whirlwind.‚Äù Churchill proclaimed that the side that bombed only military targets would certainly prevail. Often people with a conscience are compelled by the certitude of their own compassion and civility. The bombing o civilian infrastructure happened quite by accident.
In 1940, German bombers got lost over the English Channel and bombed a port city. Churchill was enraged and bombed Berlin. Hitler began a sustained bombing campaign against London and thus it began that non-combatants were free game in WWII.
On July 24th, 1942, British forces lined up 780 Lancaster bombers and launched a night raid against the northern factory town of Hamburg with a population of 1.5 million people under the name Operation Gomorrah. Hamburg was the second largest city in Germany behind Berlin and the chief manufacturing facilities for U-boats and ships of war were located there on the Elbe River. Hamburg itself was well defended with bunkers that could hold a quarter of a million people. Each bunker was able to withstand general bombing and each bunker held flak guns. Fifteen hundred ME-109s in airfields across the region protected Hamburg as well, all warned by Germany‚Äôs perfunctory radar warning system.
The British also had foil strips; today we call this chaff, and shoveled it out of their bombers to jam radars. The ten-hour raid was a masterpiece of air traffic control as it was conducted at night and involved almost 800 bombers. They hit the Blohm and Voss factory yards and all in all, the raid was a tremendous success militarily. Two days later the US sent 123 B-17s into Hamburg for a daylight raid. 20% of the B-17s were shot down, and the ME-109s were so well equipped and so determined that many went up, hit bombers and had the time to land and re arm and go up for a second run.
Sixty percent of Hamburg was destroyed and 45,000 people were killed. Over a million people fled the area and became instant refugees. The black eye delivered to the Germans was so embarrassing that Hitler refused to visit Hamburg and instead sent Goehring, head of the Luftwaffe.
A massive raid was planned for Berlin early the next year. The US 8th Air Force and British air assets launched 11,000 sorties against Berlin in ten days. The destruction was massive. 11,000 people were killed and 250,000 were made homeless. The British were convinced that if this pressure were maintained, the German would capitulate. Nothing further could be from the truth. The Germans showed no discernable loss of productivity or determination.
The internal fight between US air planner and British planners continued. The US felt that precision bombing of industrialize targets would be the best way to end the war, and the British felt a terror campaign would turn the tide. Neither side was completely correct.
On August 18th, 1943 General Akers ordered a daylight raid, unescorted against the ball bearing plants at Schweinfort. Again, it was a massacre of US aircrews with 20% casualties. US aircrews knew they had a 77% chance of dying before their 24 missions were over. The Brits also suffered high casualties; the RAF had lost 600 planes and 2700 flyers by the war‚Äôs end. The Schweinfort raid succeeded in hampering ball bearing manufacturing, and it also succeeded in ending Akers command. He was relieved of his duties and Jimmy Doolittle; the hero of the famous Doolittle Raid took over.
This time however, the Americans had a new long-range fighter, the P-51 Mustang. During bombing raids throughout the rest of 1943, Mustangs destroyed hundreds of ME-109s and Junker dive-bombers. Not only did they have the range, they had the speed as well. After escorting bombers in and out of Germany, the P-51s had enough fuel to drop down and strafe airfields over the French northwestern frontier and destroyed many German aircraft on the ground.
It‚Äôs interesting to note that during this intense battle, James Doolittle opposed bombing civilians. At the end of the day, even Eisenhower approved of Operation Thunderclap, a massive bombing campaign to flatten German cities both industrial and civilian. Experts believe that a half million Germans died as a direct result of the bombing campaign. Many Germans died of starvation in the streets or crowded into their bunkers during bombing raids. It‚Äôs also interesting to note that attacks on Leipsig and Berlin actually helped the Red Army overtake the still spirited and dangerous Wehrmacht.
Most Politicians Would Have Been Destroyed By A Fiasco Like Gallipoli. Not Winston Churchill.
Note that Operation Thunderclap never occurred. It was proposed, but ultimately decided against.
Well, if the first picture is of Hamburg in 1946 (one year after the war), and the third is of Hamburg after the war (presumably 1945 then?), then they did a marvelous job of rebuilding within a year‚Ä¶ You might want to look at the dates there.
Also apparantly the british did not ascribe the same toughness to the germans that they did to themselves, as ‚ÄúThe Blitz‚Äù only made the british more determined to end the war victorious‚Ä¶.
The first picture is NOT of Hamburg in 1946, it shows the old town of Frankfurt am Main in the area beetween the Dom and the town hall R√∂mer before it was completely destroyed at March 22 in 1944 by british forces.

The rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria has led to research on other therapeutic options in treatment of wounds. Honey has long been used in wounds to promote healing.
The process of wound healing involves a cascade of events described below (1).
This involves formation of a blood clot on the wound to impede bleeding. Blood vessels constrict restricting blood supply to the area. This is followed by adhesion of blood cells called platelets on the severed blood vessels forming a clot. Coagulation sets in by the interlocking of threadlike structures called fibrin into the clot converting into a gel like mass.
This stage involves growth of blood vessels which supply oxygen and nutrients on the wound bed. This promotes growth of granulation tissue which fills up the wound. Collagen produced by cells called fibroblasts aid in wound contraction while epithelial cells cover up the wound through a process called epithelialization. A moist and hydrated environment is required for optimal tissue growth.
In this stage the laid out connective tissue in the proliferative stage is reorganized leading to an increase in strength and flexibility.
Below we outline the properties of honey that make it a suitable treatment option in promoting wound healing (2,3).
Honey has dehydrating effects (hygroscopic) due to its high sugar content therefore inhibiting bacterial proliferation and growth in the wound even in the presence of exudates. Bacterial infection slows down wound healing.
Honey is activated when dilute (4) releases hydrogen peroxide slowly over a period of 24 hours. This prevents it from causing tissue damage as compared to commercially produced hydrogen over the same period of time. Hydrogen peroxide acts as an antiseptic and promotes growth of granulation tissue which helps foster wound contraction and consequently wound healing. Honey also contains antioxidants which prevent tissue damage from oxygen radicals produced by H2O2. Hydrogen peroxide activates tissue enzymes called proteases which help in debridement.
Honey has the ability neutralize malodors emanating from wounds due to infection. Bacteria breakdown amino acids present in necrotic tissue and exudates to produce ammonia, amines and sulphur compounds giving off a bad odor. Honey is rich in sugar (glucose) which when applied on wounds is metabolized by bacteria to lactic acid instead which has no off smell.
Honey is viscous in nature. This provides a protective barrier preventing invasion of infectious agents which cause cross infection. It also provides a moist environment which promotes growth of granulation tissue which is essential in wound healing.
It contains anti inflammatory properties. It prevents infiltration of inflammatory cells into the wound causing a reduction in edema, pain and inflammation while leaving a soothing effect.
Honey promotes tissue regeneration. Hydrogen peroxide stimulates growth of blood vessels which supply oxygen and nutrients and, fibroblasts (connective tissue cells which produce collagen) which are important in tissue growth. It‚Äôs high acidity and osmotic pressure promotes blood circulation and oxygenation which is essential for the tissue growth. Honey also contains vitamins, amino acids and other nutrients which are essential in the proliferative stage of wound healing.
Honey can also be used in wound dressings. It‚Äôs popularly used in burn wounds since its non adherent therefore minimizing trauma to the tissues and pain.
Honey inhibits production of prostaglandins which mediate the process inflammation, pain and cause immunosupression by inhibiting production of antibodies. A decrease prostaglandin levels consequently stimulates production of antibodies which are important for debridement in the inflammatory stage.
Honey is also more affordable compared to other conventional wound treatment methods.

1. Dreadful Property - Even Worse Agents!
Be warned, Amber and Co are the worst agents I have ever had to deal with. The property was in awful condition when we moved in and we had to put up with an almost daily leak coming from the flat upstairs, flooding into our bathroom. It took them almost a year to sort it out! Many other things broke such as the gas hob, the boiler, another leak in the living room. It took so long for them to respond to emails and telephone messages that by the time one thing was sorted out, another issue had developed. Moving out was the best thing we ever did. The neighbours either side are very strange who put their rubbish out in Tesco bags every day so that foxes rip them open at night and spread the mess into OUR garden - tried to talk to them about this and was met with a very aggressive response.

Africa‚Äô bloodiest civil war pillaged the Lion Mountain of this continent, a decade of senseless war raged in Sierra Leone, fuelled by Blood Diamonds. Men, women and children‚Äôs hands, arms, limbs and feet were hacked off by the swing of a machete. The perpetrators were disillusioned rebels under the command of Liberian War lord; Charles Taylor .The war inflicted a heavy toll on human capital. With approximately 20,000 deaths, 20 million displaced some 27,000 registered amputees according to UN analysis.
&apos;The Devil in Freetown (January 6)&apos; is Collins Archie-Pearce&apos;s latest venture. It depicts a true recounting of Sierra Leone‚Äôs ten year civil war. The ethos of this movie is to showcase the resilience of Sierra Leone and her people in rising up from the ashes of the war despite the human, structural and societal destruction it experience. This beautiful story line brought to life by the first-hand information volunteered by those who were affected by the war demonstrating the trauma that they went through. The date January 6th 1999, will be forever etched in the minds of Sierra Leoneans as the bloodiest day of the war. The movie reveals tha inhumane activities which took place in what had once been one of Africa‚Äôs most peaceful country.
War brings pain, despair, insurmountable loss and desolation. The message to everyone especially Sierra Leoneans is clear - the peace of one‚Äôs country/native land must be maintained and preserved at all cost. Hence the effects of this &apos;Blood Diamonds&apos; fuelled war are still prevalent in the lives of many today ‚Äì the war afflicted amputees.
70% of the population are living below poverty line, 26% are classified as extremely poor with the majority categorised as physically challenged. Life expectancy is 39 years whilst health and education indicators are among the lowest in the world. Many amputees in the provinces are not registered due to lack of access to auditing.
The producers of Devil in Freetown have pledged to render a percentage of the movie premiere‚Äôs proceeds to Melqosh Mission International, a UK based Charity, birthed to equip, educate and empower war afflicted amputees and their dependents.

Born: July 25, 1817, near Lexington, Kentucky.
Died: August 11, 1862, during the Battle of Independence, Missouri.
Buried: Woodlawn Cemetery in Independence, Missouri.
Colonel John T. Hughes was considered near kin to General Sterling Price, and enjoyed the trust and confidence of that great man. John Hughes had been with Sterling Price through the Mexican War, and the two men understood and loved each other as brothers. At the battle of Pea Ridge, when Slack fell mortally wounded, Price, who seldom made mistakes in choosing men for arduous duties, assigned Hughes to replace the fallen general. Price saw in Hughes the coming man and in this Price and Doniphan saw alike. After the battle of Pea Ridge, Hughes followed his kinsman to assist in the operations against Grant and Halleck, at Corinth.	In one month he was directed by the Confederate Government, at Richmond, to return to Missouri, and raise a brigade; which meant a	generalship for him. He was on this mission, making his way to northwestern Missouri, when he brought together, near Lee's Summit, the forces of Thompson, Hays, and Quantrill, and planned so skillfully the battle of Independence. It was during this engagement that John T. Hughes lost his life.
John T. Hughes was more than a rising general. He was a graceful writer	as well, and had he lived, would have done for Price, what Edwards did for Shelby-chronicled in classic English his achievements.	Prior to the War Between the States, John Hughes was one of the leaders of political sentiment in Northwestern Missouri. He had been a Whig all his life, until the Whig party became dominated by Knownothingism, when he acted with the Democrats. This was due to what he felt was the violent and radical assaults of the leaders of the then forming Republican Party on the Constitution. This made it impossible for him to act with them. He was a member of the State Convention that sent delegates to the National Democratic Convention of 1860, the most stormy political assemblage, perhaps, that ever met in Missouri-one of which none but the master hand of Price could control.
He held a commission as Colonel in the Missouri State Guard, which was the state militia at that time. When the Federal government usurped the will of the people, and ousted not only the duly elected Governor of Missouri, but the members of the State House of Representatives, the State Senate, the State Supreme Court, State of Missouri District Judges and all other state officers.	He moved the troops under his command and took his place alongside that brave and noble band of patriots who fought and were willing to die for their beliefs.
On August 11, 1862, Colonel John T. Hughes, commander of the Confederate troops, was killed by a shot to the head while leading a surprise attack against Federal forces. The volley came from troops under the leadership of Captains Breckinridge and Axline. Colonel Hughes fell motionless to the ground while leading a charge against the right flank of Captain Axline's position.
The surprise attack came from the Confederate Troops and Quantrill's Partisan Rangers. Captain Breckinridge was taken by such surprise that he immediately shouted: "Boys, we are completely surrounded, and we had better surrender." This was the first command heard by the troops, but it was not long before Captain Axline was able to successfully counter that order and get their men to rally a few yards from here behind a stone fence.
Captain Axline was able to repel several charges from the Confederates on this location before he received a message from over-all commander Lieutenant-Colonel James Buel ordering him to surrender to Colonel Thompson. Colonel Thompson succeeded command of the Confederates after the death of Colonel Hughes. Captain Axline reluctantly surrendered.
Promoted posthumously to Brigadier General, John T. Hughes.	The ideas and opinions are representative of B/G John T. Hughes SCV Camp #614, and L. Col. John	R. Boyd MOSB Chapter #236.

During History lessons, Class 4 are finding out about the Vikings.
We used lego to find equivalent fractions. Once we had mastered this, we tested our knowledge using cake. What a fun morning!
In English, we composed animal poems using alliteration. We used our dictionary skills to improve our vocabulary.
During their History lesson, Class 4 investigated how Neolithic people managed to build Stonehenge (October 2018).
In maths, we have been looking at more exciting ways to learn our times tables. We evented a game called ‚ÄòBunny Maths‚Äô and had great fun hopping around the classroom, collecting bundles of carrots. We challenged ourselves to see how many questions we could answer in 1 minute.
We have also been looking at more complicated multiplication. In Year 4, we think it is very important to be able to explain our thinking, so Mrs Hughes decided to it was time to take a back seat and let the class do the teaching! Everyone stepped up to the challenge and did an amazing job! Well done, Year 4!
During our first week, we talked about the characteristics that make a good friend. We used our ideas to create a friendship advertisement. Can you work out which friend is which?
In Maths, we have been looking at place value of 4 digits numbers. We also used our class novel, The Iron Man, to fit in some extra measuring skills. We estimated that we could fit approximately 300 of us in the same space as the Iron Man's head, now, that's impressive!
Viking longboats made during History lessons set sail (June 2018).
Excitement continued today when we received a letter from the Museum of Strange Objects, asking us to keep a look out for dragon eggs. On our patrols around the school, to our amazement, we found not just one, not two, not three, but FOUR giant ones scattered around the playground. We used our senses to examine these closely and will be reporting back to the Museum of Strange Objects when we have completed our investigations. What an egg-citing day!
Class 5 and Class 4 went to Upper Sitch Private Wood in Staffordshire to find out more about the Stone Age. Dan and Naomi told us all about their experiences living as Stone Age people in America. During the afternoon we made Stone Age tools and used natural materials to create our own cave art.
These brave men and women were not bashful about their devotion and service to God. They made sure that honor was given to God in their community. Parents taught their children the scriptures and made sure that they understood the importance of worshipping God in their lives and in their community.
Generations passed and parents stopped teaching their children the importance of faith in God and his place in society and instead shipped them off to government-run institutions where our children learned secular humanism and that God did not belong in the public square.
In the churches throughout the land, a place that once held significance in the local community, and was instrumental in public discourse on all things of societal life, pulpits were being filled with teachers who taught that a Christian‚Äôs citizenship was not of this world so they were not to bother themselves with the dirt and grime of politics and civics in general. Evangelicals were told to stay out of politics since it was worldly and corrupt. This left a void which was gladly filled by those who did not hold to Christian values and as such led our government down into the depths of humanism and away from God. The church said and did nothing for decades.
Now we find ourselves where we are today, adrift on the sea of worldliness driven by the winds of tyranny and debauchery. What do we find church leaders and evangelicals doing while the ship of state flounders in turbulent waters? They are supporting a secularist for the highest office in the land.
America needs a revival of spiritual fervor, a new Pentecost which will cause the body of Christ to burn with the spiritual passion once held by the pilgrims. A righteous indignation that will cause the people of God to fall on their faces and cry out to a merciful God to forgive them for their indifference and failures to pray for their leaders. America you have sinned, we have sinned against God and brought this hell down upon ourselves, we have no one to blame but ourselves.
Do we really want America back? Back to the foundations laid by the Pilgrims? Do we really wish to see one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all? Then we MUST put God back where he belongs front and center in our lives and in our communities, and yes in our government. We as a nation need to vote for God in this election and those that are to follow.
And that is the way I see it. What say you?
‚Üê Are Conservatives Really Conservative?

The college admissions interview is a valuable component of college applications because it provides admissions officers with a holistic evaluation from a source that has no vested interest in your success. This contrasts with your teacher evaluations, which are holistic but (hopefully) written by people who want you to be admitted, and your standardized tests scores, which aren't biased towards your success the way that teacher evaluations are, but which aren't holistic at all.
There's no excuse for not knowing about one of the schools you're applying to attend. In the case of UChicago, read up on its core curriculum, housing system, culture, student groups, neighborhood, academic programs, and so on. Any school wants to admit students who know a lot about it and would be excited to attend, so study up beforehand and then reflect that in your interview. Don't ask your interviewer any questions you could have answered yourself by looking online beforehand; that's a poor use of your time with them. Definitely do ask questions, though--just ones whose answers you can't find through other resources.
A few minutes late is fine, but it's impolite to keep anyone waiting for much longer than that. Pad your arrival time by ten minutes or so to account for having difficulty parking or finding the interview location. I'm personally not that uptight about this, but other people potentially could be.
...not an interrogation. I'm hoping to keep the dynamic of the interview relatively symmetric. UChicago is looking for is students who will make good conversationalists, because much of the learning at UChicago happens outside of the classroom in conversations with your peers. I'm sure the same is true of most schools. So when there's a pause in the conversation, feel very free to fill it by changing the subject, asking a question, or telling a story. Feel free to direct the conversation to the topics that most interest you, just as you would when talking to your friends.
A corollary of this attempt to foster an equal footing is that there is no need to dress up for your interview if you don't want to. Personally, I'll probably be wearing tennis shoes, jeans, and a t-shirt with some kind of math joke on it.
Don't be arrogant either, of course, but absolutely don't let modesty keep you from telling your interviewer about accomplishments you've had just because they didn't explicitly ask. Modesty is a virtue in many other contexts, but not in the college admissions process!
UChicago looks for people who are really excited about learning and their work. Convey that enthusiasm in the interview! That means talking excitedly about your favorite academic subjects, the work that you do, things you do outside of class, ideas you have, and so on.
I wouldn't have thought of this myself, but several of the students I interviewed gave me a resume or cheat sheet about themselves, or emailed me one at some point. I was frankly surprised at this, as I certainly didn't have a resume in my last year of high school. But when it came time to write up my interview reports, having a little reminder of the person I talked to was surprisingly helpful in reminding me of their accomplishments and of what we had talked about.
So I'd recommend giving your interviewer something like this at some point, or perhaps better yet, emailing it to them so they can't lose it. If you don't have a resume, (and again, not a big deal--I didn't either in high school!), you can achieve the same goal by sending your interviewer a short email that basically says, "Hey, it was great talking about X, Y, and Z with you!"
I got a strong education at UChicago and had a great time while I was there. (Indeed, my friends know all too well that at least half my stories begin, "When I was at UChicago...") So if you're applying to UChicago, then I'm delighted that you're interested in going there! If you're not, then I'd urge you to! In any case, I wish you the best of luck with your college admissions process, and particularly with any college interviews you may have.
Disclaimer: I'm just an alum, not a UChicago admissions officer. Thus, language like "UChicago looks for..." is a mixture of conjecture and prescriptive opinion about what I think UChicago Admissions ought to do. Some of this advice applies to college interviews in general, some only to interviews for UChicago, and some just for interviews with me.
mine's probably Take It From the Man!
and I don't remember what it's called. Tis ok-pretty good. I did see Anton throw a tantrum at the Troubadour just like he does in Dig! though. That was fun.
and just gets on with playing a good show. it pisses me off how people keep taunting him from the crowd.
but so many of the BJM albums are different from each other, you'd best get another!
god they're so bloody good.
i love the production on Take It From The Man! it sounds like it's some old sixties recording.
but based on quality of songs i'll have to go with Give It Back!
from that album. such a dirty spaced out riff at the start.
It's so sad the way our culture doesn't understand real rock'n'roll.
About three songs into Dig!, I knew I was in the presence of greatness and I just thought...how have these bastards kept this band from me for so long?
Was really into them in 1999-2000 ish, completely lost interest after that. Any of their later material worth while?
if you ducked out before Bravery Repetition And Noise...get the hell back in there!
These days they're not quite the band they were, but still far better than whatever's flavour of the month.
ended up seeing them live last year. quite boring and extremely long... I ended up leaving before the end. This is the only concert where I've ever done this!
for me, but they've got so many great standalone songs as well ('Crushed', 'Not If You Were The Last Dandy', 'That Girl Suicide', 'Hyperventilation' ) that it's hard to pick one out.
is the best album for me. I'm wearing my BJM t-shirt at work today and i've had to explain what it means/who they are to 4 separate people. Ahhh i love spreading the word to my un-educated work chums!

This is our second session of ‚ÄúIwata Asks‚Äù covering The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. I‚Äôve gathered you all here to talk about the theme ‚ÄúThe Dense Forest.‚Äù Please say what you worked on and introduce yourself. Fujibayashi-san was in the previous session, so let‚Äôs start with Asuke-san.
the area called the Sealed Grounds, the land that Link falls to at the beginning from the floating island named Skyloft . It‚Äôs an area that serves as a kind of connection point before you reach the game fields and dungeons. It‚Äôs an incredibly important place in the story.
Its name - the Sealed Grounds - suggests there‚Äôs something significant about it.
Yes. (laughs) A huge boss appears there. I was in charge of the area where you fight it.
I‚Äôm Hiramuki, also from EAD. The first game I worked on at Nintendo was Pikmin.1 After that, I worked on the fields of Pikmin for a long time, but then I became involved with The Legend of Zelda with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass2 for the Nintendo DS system. 1Pikmin: An AI action game for the Nintendo GameCube system in which the player searches for hidden treasure while accompanied by mysterious creatures known as Pikmin. The first game was released in October 2001 in Japan and the second game in April 2004 in Japan. Both titles were also released as part of the New Play Control! series of games for the Wii console in December 2008 and March 2009 in Japan. 2The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass: A stylus-controlled action-adventure game released in June 2007 in Japan as the first title in The Legend of Zelda series for the Nintendo DS system.
Then you started working together with Fujibayashi-san.
the dungeon called Skyview Temple .
I‚Äôm Ito from EAD. I was in charge of the overall special effects. Since joining the company, I have worked on The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker3, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess4 and The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks5, so this game was my fourth Legend of Zelda title. 3The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker: An action-adventure game released for the Nintendo GameCube system in December 2002 in Japan. 4The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess: An action-adventure game released for the Wii console and Nintendo GameCube system in November 2006. 5The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks: An action-adventure game released for the Nintendo DS system in December 2009.
We can always leave the special effects for The Legend of Zelda games to you.
To start off, this Legend of Zelda game is structured so as to provide the enjoyment of playing in familiar places. So rather than making a bunch of new game fields - as in past games - you wanted to create fields where the player can go through more than once to thoroughly enjoy the environment. First, I would like you to talk about why you decided to make it like that.
Miyamoto-san has always said that to Aonuma-san - and this time Aonuma-san said it to you! (laughs) If you make a bunch of new fields, and just stretch it out, it just gets big and can be a bit of a drag.
That‚Äôs right. I thought we could discover a new pleasure if, instead of just stretching it out, we made fields with height and depth, so that every time you went to one, you would experience a fresh surprise and discover new enjoyment.
In other words, compact doesn‚Äôt literally mean small and cramped game fields, but denser ones, while still compact.
So Hiramuki-san planned the first game field and dungeon, but you were the one who asked him to?
Yes. The forest that is the first game field is a really important place, so I asked Hiramuki-san as someone who would give it his full attention.
You worked together with Hiramuki-san on The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, so you‚Äôre old partners.
Hiramuki-san, what was on your mind as you made the forest?
Well, the forest is the first game field you visit, so I thought the most important thing was helping players get into the world of The Legend of Zelda naturally.
The first game field is incredibly important. If it makes a bad impression, players won‚Äôt go any further.
That‚Äôs right. So I decided to give the forest a bright and fun atmosphere.
Until now in the series, most of the forests have always been dim and creepy.
big mushrooms growing there and all kinds of animals and insects and little birds .
Yes. (laughs) The Bug Net is in the item selection circle along with the Bow and Bomb. It stands out - in a good way - and I think it‚Äôs very characteristic of the Legend of Zelda games.
When you actually try to catch bugs with that net, you get really tense.
That‚Äôs how realistic it is. You can experience a thrill like when you catch real cicadas or grasshoppers.
Oh, I see. The Wii MotionPlus accessory doesn‚Äôt just allow you to swing the sword however you want, but the Bug Net as well.
That‚Äôs right. The direction you swing the net is very important.
At first, you don‚Äôt have the knack for it, so you‚Äôre swinging it around all over, but it isn‚Äôt long before you get the hang of it. You say, ‚ÄúThis is the perfect angle,‚Äù and change your grip as you go around catching bugs.
And the way you do it has to change for each kind of bug. Sometimes you sweep down from above and sometimes you scoop them up from underneath.
Hmm, bug-catching itself is quite deep. The way the team puts such an astounding amount of effort on things like this really is a part of the essence of Zelda.
Yes. There are all kinds of bugs, like grasshoppers and cicadas, dragonflies and butterflies, unicorn beetles and stag beetles and mantises. There are different kinds of birds, too. It hardly ever shows up, but there‚Äôs a blue bird, too. When I see one, I shout, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the blue one!‚Äù (laughs) and get all excited and sneak up on it, and feel great when I catch it.
Do you get anything for catching insects and birds?
I think I‚Äôll talk about that some other time.

The departed men in her life still have plenty to say to Corey. Her father, a legendary rodeo cowboy who punctuated his lifelong pronouncements with a bullet to his head, may be the loudest. But in this story of Montana‚Äîa story in which the old West meets the new and tradition has its way with just about everyone‚Äîit is Corey‚Äôs voice we listen to. In this tour-de-force of voices big and small, sure and faltering, hers comes across resonant and clear, directing us to the heart of the matter.
Played out against the mythology of the Old West‚Äîa powerful amalgam of ranching history, Marlboro Men, and train robbery reenactments‚Äîthe story of the newly orphaned, spinsterish Corey is a sometimes comical, sometimes poignant tale of coming-of-age a little late. As she tries to recapture an old dream of becoming a painter‚Äîof preserving some modicum of true art amid the virtual reality of modern Montana‚ÄîCorey finds herself figuring in other dramas as well, other, younger lives already at least as lost as her own.
Mary Clearman Blew is the author of the acclaimed essay collection All But the Waltz; three books of short stories, including Sister Coyote; and is the editor of When Montana and I Were Young: A Memoir of a Frontier Childhood, available in a Bison Books edition. She is a professor of creative writing at the University of Idaho and twice has received the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Award, once in fiction and once in nonfiction, as well as the Western Literature Association‚Äôs Distinguished Achievement Award.

Wear this lace long-sleeve short sheath party dress to your next semi-formal event.
Although we haven‚Äôt played any gigs since September, we‚Äôve been busy with other stuff. We have 5 new songs in the pipeline that will be recorded and released as an EP sometime in March if all goes well. 3 out of the 5 songs will satisfy your punk rock needs while with the remaining 2 we‚Äôll experiment more in guitar pop territory. All the songs are at least 2 and a half minutes long, and we‚Äôll record all of them in English and Hungarian as well, so this will be our longest release since Shorter Than Danny DeVito.
At the end of last year we also started looking for a second guitar player. This project is on hold now due to the recording preparations, but we‚Äôll get back to this once the EP is ready. We have a candidate who seems to fit right in, but he‚Äôd need to move to Budapest first, which may or may not happen in the near future. We hope it will.
We have also started booking gigs for the spring and summer, the first dates are already up ‚Äì only Hungary so far, but hopefully we‚Äôll get more invitations soon.
These double stacked 3D Mink lashes are cut and shaped in a way to create a stunning cat eye. Like our other three 3D styles, ‚ÄúStarlet‚Äù provides maximum thickness without the weight!
Please note: All lashes come in a standard size that may need trimming to fit your eye size and shape. We suggest to trim from the outer edge not the inner edge!
What if your father was one of the 20th century‚Äôs most celebrated painters? How would you define yourself against that kind of talent and machismo?
In The Italian Teacher, his third novel, Tom Rachman sets in play just that dynamic. Bear Bavinsky is a world-famous painter, a first-class narcissist and father of 17 children who he treats with careless, sometimes callous, warmth.
Bear‚Äôs shy son Pinch loves to paint, but his ambitions are snuffed by his father‚Äôs offhand critique: ‚ÄúI got to tell you, kiddo. You‚Äôre not an artist and you never will be.‚Äù After that, nothing in Pinch‚Äôs life seems to gel.
When Bear abandons his family, Pinch strives to make himself worthy of his father‚Äôs attention, first trying to be a painter himself; then resolving to write his father‚Äôs biography; eventually settling, disillusioned, into a job as an Italian teacher in London.
With Rachman‚Äôs signature humanity and humor, The Italian Teacher examines a life lived in the shadow of greatness. If you enjoyed William Boyd‚Äôs Any Human Heart, you‚Äôll love this portrait of Pinch, who has the good luck to both outlive and survive his famous father, and to find, in the end, a way to take ownership of his difficult legacy.

The Education Unlimited Tuition Assistance Program provides partial tuition assistance awards to those who can demonstrate financial need. The largest awards will not exceed 50% of the program's total tuition; College Tour and Summer Focus awards typically do not exceed 25% of the program cost. In most recent years EU has been able to designate over $100,000 in partial assistance awards each summer. The Tuition Assistance Program is the program under which most families have historically received aid awards from Education Unlimited. Tuition assistance is applicable only as a discount and only toward Education Unlimited programs and only for the Education Unlimited program originally applied for. All Tuition Assistance awards are solely at the discretion of Education Unlimited's Tuition Assistance Committed and Executive Director.
Deadlines: Applications are reviewed as they are received and decisions are generally sent with in 10 days to two weeks after the compolete application is received. Priority consideration is given to application received by May 1 or each year. We will continue to review Tuition Assistance applications throughout the summer, however, fewer funds may be available for Tuition Assistance later in the season. If you do not apply by May 15, 2018 it may be only shortly before the camp session that you receive notification of our award decision.
If you apply for tuition assistance within 3 days of submitting an application for camp and you receive an assistance award that you feel does not meet your financial need, if you notify us in writing within 10 days of receiving your assistance award that you still can't afford to come and need to cancel, all money paid on deposit for that camp will be refunded. Because of the guarantees for housing, meals and meeting rooms, commitments to staff, etc, that must be made in advance on behalf of applicant families, we cannot extend this 'refund of deposit when aid award is not sufficient' exception to aid applications received after 3 days from the date of initial application for enrollment has passed.
To Apply: Download an application from our website or request one by email. Please review the details on the application to learn more. If you have additional questions, please contact us by phone or email.
Another drawing from Hudson, Ohio. This is the town's bandstand where weekly concerts are held on Sunday nights in the summer.
This one has the names, "Tim", "Sandee", "Luke", and "Tyler" hidden in it. Maybe you can find them by clicking on this picture and looking around.
Heavy stock paper, rapidograph pen, the usual thing. Lots of pen strokes.
Discover God in the world around you.
"Our world is saturated with grace, and the lurking presence of God is revealed not only in spirit but in matter ‚Äì in a deer leaping across a meadow, in the flight of an eagle, in fire and water, in a rainbow after a summer storm, in a gentle doe streaking through a forest, in Beethoven‚Äôs Ninth Symphony, in a child licking a chocolate ice cream cone, in a woman with windblown hair. God intended for us to discover His loving presence in the world around us."
Do you know the name of the Artist who made this scene? I simply took a picture in HIS presence.
Look for this picture to be turned into a "Shuwork" in the near future.
I drew this picture a number of years ago. This town is just north of my hometown of Stow, Ohio.
I have always liked the views in this town. This clock tower is a well known landmark.
I enjoyed drawing this picture, however, that's a lot of leaves to draw, ain't it?
Pen: Rapidograph technical pen, 0.25 and 0.35, naturally.
Three best tools for pen and ink work - .35, .25 Rapidograph, .38 Uni-ball.
Close up of the .25 rapidograph. There is a lot of relaxation in the point of that pen. These pens can be expensive in the store, but you can find great deals of ebay. I did.
Here are the sermon notes from this morning at Black Forest Christian Fellowship. Mr. Jerry DeRenzo, a middle school teacher at BFA, spoke on God's love.
Jerry's messages are always full of great word pictures that are easy to draw into notes. Thanks Jerry for the encouragement today.
- Paper: Moleskine blank journal, 5.25x8.25, 13x21cm, what a great book! The paper is heavy and smooth, and takes gel ink perfectly.

SEATTLE - If you look up the term "sport utility vehicle" in your handy World Book Encyclopedia, don‚Äôt be surprised to find a picture of a Word War II Jeep prominently displayed at the top of the page.
Sure, the burbs are now crawling with sport-utes capable of satisfying the diverse needs of every sporting cult and off-road religion imaginable. We have everything from the mini-sport-utes such as the Chevy Tracker, Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V, to the big luxo-barges such as the Range Rover, Lincoln Navigator and GMC Denali.
Surprisingly, what started out as a simple, yet durable conveyance that could take you beyond the end of the trail - a Jeep - wound up trailblazing a market segment that has been dividing and multiplying like an amoeba run amok. The number of sport-utility nameplates totals at least three dozen, with perhaps a dozen more on the way - including new models from Ford, Mazda, BMW, Cadillac, Volkswagen, Porsche and Nissan.
While today‚Äôs teens probably think it was always like this, it wasn‚Äôt. In fact, in 1984, just a scant 15 model-years ago, Jeep (then part of American Motors) introduced the very first compact four-door Cherokee. The only other four-door sport-utes available at the time were big brutes, such as the Jeep Grand Wagoneer, Chevy/GMC Suburban, Toyota Land Cruiser and International Travel-all (remember that one?).
If you happened to come from a dyed-in-the-wool Jeep family, your dad may have driven a Grand Wagoneer or CJ5, while your granddad drove a Willys Jeep - in WWII.
Frankly, it wasn‚Äôt until the arrival of the first Jeep Grand Cherokee in 1992 (a Chrysler brand by this time), that the carlike sport-utility market really started growing in earnest.
So what‚Äôs a company such as Jeep going to do, with everybody and their brother-in-law trying to push you off the trail and take away your business?
After a daylong trek along winding Washington backroads and over rutted logging trails, the answer is quite evident: leave them in your dust. Without exaggeration, that seems to be precisely what Jeep has done with the introduction of its virtually all-new 1999 Grand Cherokee. While that may seem like a tall order, it‚Äôs something Chrysler has some experience doing. As most people will recall, Chrysler also invented the minivan market and has done a more than adequate job of protecting its "home turf" with each succeeding version of its popular minivan.
So given the monumental assault on the Jeep brand, it‚Äôs not the least bit surprising to find Chrysler doing the same thing all over again. What that means, down here where the rubber meets the road, is not being content to rest on your laurels. And for the Grand Cherokee, that would have been an easy thing to do. With over a dozen awards under its beltline, the Grand Cherokee has impressed every off-road magazine and organization on the planet. But Chrysler realized that standing pat would be sure suicide.
Just to prove that didn‚Äôt happen, communications guru Bud Liebler proudly displayed the little bag of 127 carry-over parts that are the only remnants of the previous Grand Cherokee still attached to the 1999 model. Other than the oil filter, key fob and rearview mirror, the remaining bits and pieces are mostly nuts, bolts and other fasteners.
"We are well aware that in this extremely competitive segment, the battle for the best sport-utility vehicle is being fought on-road as well as off-road," said Tom Gale, executive vice president - Product Strategy, Design and general manager Jeep Operations. "We are not about to yield to anyone when it comes to delivering the best combination of capability and comfort. We plan to keep aggressively building on Grand Cherokee's strong sales record and award-winning history."
As more and more automakers "top off" their product lines with sport-utility vehicles, the Jeep brand stands out as the only American brand dedicated solely to this market segment -- and one that has been continuously refined for more than five decades.
Major changes to the all-new 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee include all-new exterior and interior design, two all-new engines, a new five-speed automatic transmission, a much-refined new Quadra-Drive‚Ñ¢ 4WD system, new suspensions front and rear, new steering system, and an all-new braking system. It may seem like a lot of tinkering was done to an already outstanding product, but as a result of these changes, the 1999 Grand Cherokee now has new levels of luxury, refinement, performance, handling and innovation combined with robust, Rubicon-proven capability that put it in a class by itself.
First we‚Äôll start with the new design.
The look of this new Grand Cherokee retains the character of the previous model, but is more fluid, refined and dynamic. Flanked by jewellike round quad-headlamps, the signature Jeep grille sits at a more rakish tilt and is less angular. From the side, it‚Äôs characterized by a steeply raked windshield, arced roof and stretched trapezoidal wheel arches, which work together to give the vehicle a more athletic stance. In the rear, the bold tri-color taillamps are larger, and more distinctive.
The new Grand Cherokee rides on the same wheelbase but has an inch wider track, is 4.4 inches longer, 2.2 inches higher and 1.6 inches wider than the previous-generation vehicle. Step-in height is reduced by 1.1 inches, for easier entry. However, the seating position is actually an inch higher for better "command-of-the-road" vision.
If luxury is what you‚Äôre looking for, the Grand Cherokee certainly does not disappoint. The interior offers refined luxury, with excellent fit, finish and refinement throughout the cabin, as well as an ergonomic design. The driver now has all primary controls at fingertip distance, grouped on stalks around the steering wheel. Even most radio/cassette/compact disc controls are integrated on the back of the steering wheel. There‚Äôs also an excellent blend of materials and textures, plus an obvious attention to detail in the many soft-touch surfaces.

no diffence to the Owls & Kestrels who use our boxes, all designs create the perfect roost & nest sites.
Welcome to the Barn Owl Centre's Nest Box Page to support nesting Barn Owls.
Buy with confidence & be assured that you are being supplied a nest box that is made by a dedicated Owl Conservation charity. The safety of nest boxes are very important to us & the birds we build them for.
With 14 years of experience working closely with Owls & Kestrels in the wild we are pleased that the nest boxes we make are spread over all areas of the UK countryside, we feel very proud that we provide suitable homes for Barn Owls, Tawny Owls, Little Owls & Kestrels.
We can delivery Nest Boxes to all areas of the UK or Nest Boxes can be picked up from the Centre as an option to save on the delivery charge, to arrange pick up you will need to call us first on 01452 383999.
England and Wales is a standard delivery cost, for all deliveries to Scotland and outer islands of mainland UK, please call us before placing an order as the courier cost for delivery will vary.
PLEASE NOTE : Please supply your contact telephone number when you place your order, this can be very useful if the courier becomes lost or if for some reason they have a problem finding the delivery address you have given.
Our courier can call you for directions if we struggle to find you; some properties are sometimes harder to find than others especially if they are in remote areas of the countryside. Our aim is to get the nest box to you.
If you need to contact us for any reason, this you can do at any time, including evenings, please note that we do operate a 24hr Rescue Centre too. For office hours, the best time to call is between 9am until 9pm, evenings are better though.
For more information click on the headings below.
For Barn Owls & Kestrels, position the box close to or within areas of rough grassland, this type of habitat contains the Barn Owls & Kestrels main prey source, which is Short tailed Voles, Field Mice & Shrews. For Tawny Owls & Little Owls, locate the box close to or within habitats above or in areas of mixed farmland with mature trees. If you have wooded habitat areas, this can be a preferred habitat location for the woodland Tawny Owl.
The best height to position the nest box is between 10ft to 16ft, make sure that the box is positioned securely & out of reach of people & out of reach of grazing animals.
With the porch fixed around the entrance hole, this allows the entrance of the nest box to be faced in any direction as it offers more protection from the weather. A nest box without an entrance porch simply allows driving rain & wind to enter.
The nest box & entrance hole should be made visible at a distance; this will enable the Owls to locate it. Please take into account any leaf foliage as this could grow over & obscure the entrance hole, do not hide the box from the Owl it is intended for. If an Owl was looking for a natural tree hollow, the hollow could be facing any direction & yet visible to an Owl, your nest box simply acts as a man made tree hollow so make its presence & entrance visible for the birds to get the best results.
To protect your own Nest Box project, please take into account the main dangers such as busy (A & B) roads & also live railway lines, fast traffic will kill Owls so please look at positioning a nest box well away from these dangerous areas. Also be aware of domestic pets if you are planning to position a Barn Owl nest box within a residential garden please call for advice before purchasing an Owl box.
Our nest boxes are large, spacious & most important they are built to last. Also they are designed to blend perfectly within the countryside.
This can be found inside the nest box when it arrives, to access the bracket, simply undo the four screws on the roof, your instructions will also be found inside when entering.
The small profit we generated from nest box sales help fund the conservation work of our charity in support of wild Owls.
As a charity, we have a great track record with all our customers, which includes many years of after sales support if required, this we feel we can guarantee & at no extra cost. Our aim is to help make your own projects as successful as ours.
Office hours are between 9am until 9pm, 7 days a week.
We normally always stock nest boxes because we need them to support the ongoing projects we are involved in. All boxes are made at the Barn Owl Centre's workshop by our team of Owl Conservationists.
The small amount of profit made from each nest box sale is of great importance to supporting the aims & objectives of our charity. For further information please read the below or call us, we are here to help.

The interesting history of it's owner follows. This would have belonged to Thomas Bruce the 7th Earl of Elgin and 11th earl of Kincardin, ambassador to the Ottoman empire and known for thereafter removing the statues of the Parthenon.
He'd also divorced his beautiful, equally interesting and somewhat unfaithful wife Mary (arranged marriage) that same year in 1807 , who among other indignities, was compeled to dress as a man to attend strictly segregated Ottoman ceremonies. It still carries the tags of an early fifth Avenue antique dealer. This fascinating piece of Georgian silver is very slightly. Bent at the tip, perhaps by marble?

The Idea : The core group of IInfrasol Services had a compelling vision to introduce IT Infrastructure advantages across various industry levels. They realized that small and medium businesses were hesitant to invest in technology due to the initial cost factor. These businesses were losing out on to competition in the long run due to lack of technology. This generated the idea to work closely towards a solution, which would bring in technology advantages to such businesses as well as keep cost well within reach.
Formation : The Promoters then aligned themselves to undertake various roles within the organization to make IInfrasol fully functional. Armed with technical expertise, certifications and a shared experience of above 45 man years, they reached out to Customers as well as Vendors to align the requirements of the industry. It was a win-win situation for everybody. From thereon, there was no looking back and today, IInfrasol Services is known as a tough competitor in IT Infrastructure Solutions and Services.

For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôve just confirmed the current behavior of the ‚ÄúUp/Menu‚Äù button on my own personal Fenix 5 (middle button on the left side of the watch), testing it within an app, as well as from the watch face/default watch screen. It behaves as follows, which I hope is what you would expect is the ‚Äúfixed‚Äù or correct behavior.
short-press: UP within an app.
long-press: Brings up MENU within that same app (did NOT bring up the Garmin system menu).
The only time I could get a long-press of the UP/Menu button to bring up the system menu was when the watch was in ‚Äúwatch face‚Äù mode, NOT running an app.
If you are able to somehow make the legacy Garmin app available for the Fenix 5 again, I‚Äôd be 1) incredibly grateful, and 2) happy to help with beta testing or feedback of any kind.
Oh, and I would also NOT expect any continued support or help with bugs, given that you‚Äôve already stated you‚Äôre moving away from the Garmin platform.
Thanks again for the excellent resource/platform that RaceQS provides!

SALISBURY‚ÄôS poor run of form continued with a surprise defeat at home to relegation threatened Gosport Borough.
Gosport, who before the game were without a win in sixth, and currently occupy the final relegation spot in the league, were the better side throughout the game, and it was they who looked like the team pushing for a favourable play-off spot.
A goalless first half saw chances for both sides ‚Äì Roberts had a good opportunity for Boro just after ten minutes from a corner after Whelan failed to track him, but volleyed over.
Another big huge chance came and went for the visitors.
A counter attack around the 20-minute mark left Sekajja one-on-one with Hallett about 8 yards out, and the forward should‚Äôve scored, only to be denied by Hallett to knock it wide.
The first half remained goalless, despite Fitchett hitting the crossbar in the 38th minute, and Gosport‚Äôs Lanahan was left unmarked for a free header, but was underneath it leaning backwards.
It sailed comfortably over the bar.
Shephard should‚Äôve put the Whites in front just before half time. A ball in behind the defence from Benson on the right hand set Fitchett free, who proceeded towards the goal. Strolling into the penalty area unmarked was Shephard.
Fitchett pulled it back, and Shephard proceeded to blast it miles over the bar. Salisbury‚Äôs best chance of the half and maybe the game.
Salisbury improved at the start of the second half but couldn‚Äôt find the net. Sparkes should‚Äôve scored with a golden chance just after the hour mark from the edge of the six yard box, but blasted his effort comfortably wide.
Moments later, a Wheeler foul gave Gosport a freekick in a very promising position, and captain Davis bent his effort over the wall and into the bottom corner, and Boro‚Äô took the lead.
A nightmare five minutes for Wheeler was compounded when a second yellow card saw the captain take an early bath ‚Äì the defender took down Pennery, who would‚Äôve been through on goal from a counter attack. It was a stonewall second yellow, and the Salisbury man can‚Äôt have any complaints about either booking.
Salisbury remained on the back foot for the closing periods of the game and took a deserved two-nil lead in extra time.
Despite some heroic saves from Hallett, Lanahan doubled his side‚Äôs lead.
It could be that this is what you want.
So cheap you could build a wall between you and the TV and slowly demolish it as you use the bricks as missiles.
I have often wanted to do that but with the TV and not the Laptop screen.
Better still is to throw something at the screen that will vent your spleen but not the screen.
Now on Ebay you can find the very thing as there are some traders that sell foam bricks for that very purpose.

Incubus rose to become one of the most popular alt-metal bands of the new millennium, setting themselves apart from a crowded field with a somewhat less-negative outlook and tireless touring. Formed in 1991 in the San Fernando Valley suburb of Calabasas, CA, group members Brandon Boyd (vocals, percussion), Mike Einziger (guitar), Alex Katunich (aka Dirk Lance; bass), and Jos√© Pasillas (drums) were all tenth grade classmates when they got together. Their early funk-metal sound was heavily influenced by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but broadened over the next few years to incorporate thrash, rap-metal, post-grunge rock, and grinding alt-metal √† la Korn or the Deftones. By the time the group graduated from high school, they had already been playing all-ages shows around southern California on a regular basis. In 1995, Incubus added hip-hop turntablist DJ Lyfe (aka Gavin Koppel) to their lineup and recorded the independently released album Fungus Amongus. That, coupled with their strong local following, helped the band get a deal with Epic subsidiary Immortal.
Incubus' first major-label release was the six-song EP Enjoy Incubus, which was released in early 1997 and consisted of previous demos that were revamped in the studio. Later in the year, their first full-length album, S.C.I.E.N.C.E., was released. Incubus hit the road with a vengeance, opening for bands like Korn, Primus, 311, Sublime, and Unwritten Law. By the summer of 1998, the band had amassed enough of a following to land a slot on that year's Ozzfest tour. They also wound up the year as part of Korn's inaugural Family Values tour, by which time DJ Lyfe had departed and been replaced by DJ Kilmore (first name Chris). With their momentum and exposure slowly building, Incubus returned to the studio and delivered their follow-up album, Make Yourself, in late 1999. The group went right back out on the road, and their stint on the 2000 Ozzfest helped crystallize the new audience that the single "Pardon Me" was pulling in. Although Make Yourself barely broke the Top 50 on the album charts, it was a steady seller that eventually pushed past the double-platinum mark. The second single, "Stellar," was a smaller-sized hit on rock radio, but the album's biggest song didn't hit the airwaves until 2001; "Drive" was a left-field success that became their first Top Ten hit on the pop charts. Incubus expanded their audience by playing Moby's Area: One package tour that summer, and with "Drive" still fresh in the public's mind, released their next album, Morning View, in the fall of 2001. It entered the charts at number two, confirming that Incubus had diligently worked themselves into stardom. "Wish You Were Here," "Nice to Know You," and "Warning" were all popular on rock radio, and the band naturally toured heavily in support -- this time as a headliner.
In early 2003, Incubus became embroiled in a contract dispute with Sony and filed a lawsuit to have their deal terminated under California labor laws. In April, the band announced the departure of bassist Dirk Lance. Within days, fellow Incubus guitarist Mike Eiziger called upon his Time Lapse Consortium mate Ben Kenney to be Lance's permanent replacement. The group remained a part of the Sony empire, however, and released A Crow Left of the Murder on Epic/Immortal in early 2004, which hit number two on the Billboard Top 200. Some touring followed before Incubus headed home in November to take a well-deserved break. The guys spent the next two years individually exploring things outside of the band -- music, art, film, and literature endeavors all included -- though they also remembered to work on and finish their sixth album, recorded over a year's time in both L.A. and Atlanta. The resulting record, Light Grenades, appeared in late November 2006.

In the same week that Imogen Murray, 24 from Leicestershire, is announced as a long list reserve for Equestrian Team GBR‚Äôs World Equestrian Games squad, she claimed victory in the CIC* class at Great Witchingham International in Norfolk.
It may come as a surprise to some that this is a first international win for the young rider who finished 11th at this year‚Äôs Mitsubishi Motor‚Äôs Badminton Horse Trials. With numerous National wins and International placings to her name, the win was seeming ever elusive.
‚ÄúA first International win seems a long time coming. We probably all assumed it would be with Fred (Wiseguy IV) or Charles (Ivar Gooden), as I came pretty close at Barbury with both of them, but Petal is an out and out superstar. She‚Äôll love being ‚Äòthe best horse on the yard'‚Äù commented Imogen.
Paired with the diminutive in nature but big in personality and scope, I‚Äôve Dun Talking, the pair jumped their way to victory in Saturday‚Äôs jumping phases, under the hot Norfolk sun. Despite having lead the feature International class with her second ride SJL Convince Me, after Friday‚Äôs dressage, the 14.2hh dun mare galloped ahead of her younger stable mate to claim the win.
I‚Äôve Dun Talking has gone from strength to strength this season, successfully finishing on her dressage score on each competitive appearance. Her first international victory follows swiftly on from a 3rd place finish in the competitive Keysoe Open Novice, and a 7th place in her first Intermediate at Aston-Le-Walls in May.
Imogen now heads to Barbury Castle International Horse Trials this week with three rides in the CIC** and Ivar Gooden, making his competitive return after his Badminton break, in the highly competitive Event Rider Masters CIC***.

For yet another example of the Bush administration‚Äôs war on science, take a look the Sunday New York Times today. It seems that James Hansen, a NASA climate scientist, has been talking a little bit too much about global warming. The White House wants him to cool it.
The party line apparently is that global warming is a myth, despite disturbing evidence that the average sea level globally has been steadily rising, indicating polar ice cap meltdown. (See this BBC article about rising sea levels for details.)The Daily Kos has a great commentary on the NYT article by DarkSyde, who seems to have an inside track on the allegations.
You might be hearing a lot of talk about the carnivore diet in the weight loss cliques as of late and one of the main reasons for that could very well be because of Dr. Shawn Baker. For those that haven't heard of this yet, it's basically what it sounds like, a diet that consists of just meat.
No fruits. No vegetables. No carbs. Just meat.
But before anything else, let's talk about Dr. Shawn Baker for a little bit. For those that do not know him, he's an advocate of "Zero Carb Eating" which is what the carnivore diet is. And outside of that, he's also an orthopedic surgeon and an athlete that holds INSANE indoor-rowing world records. Impressed yet?
In this episode, you‚Äôll hear the story behind how Dr. Shawn Baker got started on his journey of health problems to fixing it with major dietary changes. It involved going on a low carb diet to the ketogenic diet to finally finding his ideal diet of just meat.

Happy New Year to all of you. Last year was a terrific one personally and professionally for me. I hope that yours was as well and that 2015 will be even better.
I do not think you need to introduce God into the mix. This act is neither moral nor ethical because he is cheating his customers and profession at the same time. Morality, on the other hand, is what we would call a descriptive science. Your discussion regarding the definition, Ian, is well said and resonates with a major breakdown in our governance that has been a burr under my saddle for a long time and which no one ever talks about. It is difficult to hold a metaphorical mirror up to ourselves which can help us see our true selves. You make some good arguments but let me see if I can counter them to your satisfaction.
A proper understanding of ethics would solve a lot of problems. Your ethics are what makes you a good politician. Put simply, morals are the customs established by group of individuals whereas ethics defines the character of an individual. Life is a universal, objective value. Life is also a dual value ‚Äî we value our own life and the lives of others. And beyond a certain level of wealth, wealth accumulated by one person or group has the potential to harm the greater good. I also acknowledge here and in other sections that cultures are typically the arbiters of justice; they define what is right and wrong, and the people implicitly agree by their obedience to the rules.
A doctor is bound with the Hippocratic Oath which frames the structure of the working ethics of the medical world. Ethics is vital for a society because a society has ways of praising such behavior while at the same time reprimanding conducts that are against the ethical code of behavior. Ethics is innately knowable and requires introspection for greater understanding. Of course, not all religions are the same, some are more liberal than others and some more conservative, but in general, all religious traditions believe that their faith represents a path to enlightenment and salvation. The innate knowledge of ethics must have arisen after the formation of the planet earth. The income-tax recognized and exempts certain percentage of income-tax towards donation from the total income.
Is There A Difference Between Ethics And Morality In Business?
There is a fine line dividing the two. I see religion as a source of darkness, encouraging ignorance by answering questions with no answer; which retards curiosity in many to my amazement, not all. Respect for the universal life value sets us apart from our enemies. Morals refer to an individual's own principles regarding right and wrong. If you would prefer a physical copy, you can purchase To be honst,lotta philosophers and professors have failed to lay down a obvious line between the moral vs ethics. All three elements together conflict each other.
Change the tax structure, healthcare mandates, trade laws, transit spending‚Äîvirtually everything you do means someone will win, and someone will lose. Think of morals as deriving from the instincts that allow a young social mammal to survive long enough to become a full member of the group; and think of ethics as deriving from the instincts that make it possible for peers to work together efficiently. Choose one term and stick with it. Ethics are more a code of conduct set forward by the community. Individuals need to choose to be ethical in order for civil society to function properly. Wealthy and powerful people, by acting in concert and giving each other advantages at a personal level, can actually bend the overall playing field in a way a normal group of middle class friends cannot. And at what moment in the history of the world did this materialization occur? Ethical understanding is critically important, and so in math and science in the modern world.
My mind tends to lean in the direction of sweeping abstraction, but I think these abstraction make sense of a lot of concrete detail. Ethics deals with codes of conduct set my policies in the workplace and morality is the standards that we individually set for ourselves in regards to right and wrong. All culture needs to be continuously pruned; we need to keep the good and reject the bad. It sets our priorities in life, i. Now it may be that politicians to some extent do help out buddies because they are fond of them. I would also say that ethics transcend culture, religion, and time as well as being based on introspection. Maybe this will further the discussion in finding from sociology some basic commonly used terms.
The difference is that the ethos of a society or culture deals with its foundational philosophy, its concept of values, and its system of understanding how the world fits together. Here the lawyer knows that his client is and, if released on the charges, can repeat his crime. These three items are reducible, then can be viewed from an ethical perspective. Maybe the worlds philosophers should try working on more materialistic problems instead of these endless, and in the end, pointless arguments. His morals take a back seat as compared to his legal ethics.
It appears to me that the ultimate source of ethics is a belief in a higher power. It was burned to the ground by a group of ignorant and fearful Christians, responding to the power grab of a bishop at the time. His five now six moral pillars use the term morality, and three of these items are purely cultural. God is a powerful idea, but it is simply that. Flexibility Ethics are dependent on others for definition.
As I have said before, we are each of us two people, one social, one private. Citizens give the State authority over them, and this can be easily abused. Looking at Personal Freedom or Governmental Authority with a level of absolute sanctity for either is a problem. Information for this video gathered from The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy and more! We greatly encounter moral and ethical issues, in our day to day life. The state can use power memes of nationalism and authority to control people in the same way religion controls people with their memes. The law applies to all the citizens whether they want or not.
Ethics exists in the gray. Mankind has been laying the groundwork for its own self-imposed genocide for quite some time now with the advent of industrial civilization providing a significant amplifying effect in this conscious and unconscious endeavor. Conflicts Between Ethics and Morals One professional example of ethics conflicting with morals is the work of a defense attorney. Ultimately, the science of ethics is concerned with what is right, and morality is concerned with what is accepted. Some people talk about their personal ethics, others talk about a set of morals and everyone in a society is governed by the same set of laws. By questioning and thinking about God I came to understand the meme. You can be ethically minded and not equate fairness and equality; actually ethical understanding helps to avoid that problem.

How much will it cost to get your Private Pilots License?
That depends on how much time and effort you can dedicate to learning to fly. However, the cost of the aircraft and instructor can also make a big difference.
The FAA requires a minimum of 40 hours flight time for a private pilots license. At least 20 hours of that time must be with an instructor, the other 10 must be solo. Keep in mind the national average for getting a private pilots license is 70 hours. So we will assume it will take you 70 hrs of flight time and 50 hours of instruction (flight and ground).
As you can see getting your rating with the Flying 20 can save you a substantial amount of money! Please note this is a rough estimate, prices are subject to change and your own costs may vary.

A mouse study suggests that some Alzheimer‚Äôs symptoms are made worse by falling body temperature ‚Äî and are helped by improving body temperature.
A finding that Alzheimer's sufferers' failure to recognize familiar faces is rooted in an impairment in holistic perception rather than memory loss, suggests new strategies to help patients recognize their loved ones for longer.
A large long-running study adds to growing evidence that higher levels of physical activity reduce brain atrophy and Alzheimer's risk, and shows that many types of aerobic activity are beneficial.
A stress hormone has been found to be associated with more amyloid-beta protein, in mice and human neurons.
The finding helps explain why stress is a risk factor for Alzheimer's.
A previous 38-year study supports this with the finding that women who scored highly in "neuroticism" in middle age, had a greater chance of later developing Alzheimer's.
This link was largely accounted for by chronic stress experienced by these women over the four decades.
Comment on Christopher Warburton‚Äôs "Globalizing Sierra Leone"
Well written, Prof, but we need to put in place the necessary physical and social infrastructure for this globalising to be effective and sustainable.
That is what, I am convinced, the present regime is aiming to achieve in the next 5 to 10 years. After the placement of those structures, globalising will happen almost over night as the basic infrastructures, especially the cyber(IT) infrastructure, would have been in place.

In the first case of its kind involving the upcoming election, the Justice Department Friday announced that a Russian national has been charged with conspiracy to interfere in the U.S. political system, including the 2018 midterm election.
In a criminal complaint, authorities alleged that Khusyaynova, 44, of St. Petersburg, Russia, served as the chief accountant of ‚ÄúProject Lakhta,‚Äù a Russian umbrella effort funded by Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin and two companies he controls, Concord Management and Consulting LLC, and Concord Catering.
Authorities alleged that Khusyaynova managed the financing of Project Lakhta operations, including foreign influence activities directed at the United States.
The financial documents she controlled include detailed expenses for activities in the United States, such as expenditures for activists, advertisements on social media platforms, registration of domain names, the purchase of proxy servers and ‚Äúpromoting news postings on social networks,‚Äù the Justice Department alleged in a press release.
Between January 2016 and June 2018, Project Lakhta‚Äôs proposed operating budget totaled more than $35 million, although only a portion of these funds were directed at the United States, the Justice Department said. Between January and June 2018 alone, Project Lakhta‚Äôs proposed operating budget totaled more than $10 million.
Those involved, the Justice Department alleged, ‚Äútook extraordinary‚Äù steps to make it appear as if they were ordinary American political activists. This included the use of virtual private networks and other means to disguise their activities and to obfuscate their Russian origin.

SEAT's Toledo has long occupied an odd spot in the company's range, it sitting above the Leon, but being largely based on the same underpinnings.
SEAT's Toledo has long occupied an odd spot in the company's range, it sitting above the Leon, but being largely based on the same underpinnings. Previously that's meant a three-box shape (something it's reverted to), a familiar profile with bonnet, roof and boot, but with this third generation Toledo SEAT came over all MPV-esque, the Toledo going tall and mono-box, its looks and role much like its Altea relation. That might explain its relatively short production run, it only lasting a scant four years, SEAT's replacement reverting back to the familiar three-box layout.
Utilising Volkswagen Group underpinnings and powertrains means the SEAT Toledo was offered with much the same engine choices as you'll find in the Leon, Volkswagen Golf, Audi A3 and Skoda's Octavia. That means everything from 1.8-litre turbocharged petrol units, to a 170hp 2.0 TDI diesel. Forget both of those, as the Toledo was only ever sold in Ireland fitted with its more sensible powerplants. Scour the classifieds and you'll find little but 1.6-litre petrol engines or the ubiquitous 1.9 TDI unit on offer under the Toledo's bonnet.
That 1.6-litre petrol delivers 102hp and returns an average fuel consumption figure of 7.7 litres/100km; the 1.9-litre TDI delivers 105hp and an official combined fuel consumption figure of 5.4 litres/100km. The diesel is the quicker of the pairing, not thanks to its greater hp figure, but its greater torque, that making the TDI model an easier, punchier drive. That's particularly true if you've filled up the spacious cabin with passengers - something it's rather adept at doing. The diesel is additionally offered with a six-speed automatic gearbox, but it's a rare option, so don't hold your breath on finding one.
The Toledo's interior majors on SEAT's usual mix of simplicity and user friendliness. While the expansive black plastics on the dashboard are not quite up to the standard of its Volkswagen Group stable mates, that was always reflected in its price when new. All drive decently too, with reasonable handling for a family car and a comfortable ride.
It only survived on SEAT's price lists for four years, its position in the line-up rather negated by SEAT's own Altea XL, which brought all the passenger carrying utility and large boot space of the Toledo with lower purchase and running costs.
Choice is fairly limited, but you don't really need anything other than that 1.9-litre TDI diesel engine. The petrol is okay, but if you plan on filling it up with people, or venturing out of town on longer journeys, you'll be glad of the diesel's extra flexibility. All came generously specified as standard, so as a minimum you should expect to get air conditioning, remote central locking and alloy wheels among the standard equipment list.
Odd as this third generation Toledo might be its relative obscurity, mixed with decent practicality make it a useful family purchase on the used market. Only limited availability means there aren't many to choose from, but a 1.9 TDI engine for economy and performance with a middling specification could just make for the perfect, if unusual, family car.

The opening round of the season in Melbourne produced few technical upgrades, although most of what was brought to the final test session was intended for the opening races of 2015. Whilst we can expect a few more bits for Malaysia, this Technical Highlights post runs through a couple of the larger developments from the teams from the final Barcelona test and the minor detail changes made for Australia.
Melbourne confirmed what we realistically knew was going to occur for this year ‚Äì another season of dominance. The W06 looked better than every car out there even on Friday, when both drivers were struggling with the setup. Their advantage is to the tune of ~1.3s over a single lap and about 0.7s per lap in a race situation. For all we know they could have turned down the power unit for the race on Sunday!
As far as upgrades, the Silver Arrows had a subtle change to the nose which tapers more aggressively up to the specified point 150mm forward of the front wheel centreline before cutting diagonally downwards to meet the front bulkhead. The new shape encourages air passing along the side of the nose to duck underneath, head towards the splitter section and work the floor a little harder.
Although Red Bull already run the stub/short-tip nose, rumour is that they are producing one in the Williams form factor to increase overall downforce.
However this nose was not present in Australia as apparently it failed its crash test just before the race weekend. The stubbed noses are harder to pass the crash tests as they have a much shorter crumple zone to dissipate energy so expect nose developments to come around about China, if not Spain.
A late development to the RB11 in testing is this continuous leading edge rear wing endplate slot (red), which connects the horizontal louvres above the wing planes with the vertical slot at the front of the ‚Äòplate by the rear tyre.
As individual components, these slots act as pressure equalisers at their respective positions on the endplate: the horizontal louvres reduce the pressure gradient at the wing tips for better management of the vortices the wing sheds at speed, and the vertical slot cleans up turbulence generated by the rotating rear tyre.
Joined together, however, offers a better pressure distribution across the entire endplate rather than at localised points. This will have some implications on how the car produces its upwash effect at the rear but the main purpose of doing this conjoined slot is to reduce drag rather than gain downforce. It will be interesting to see if this catches on across the grid.
New since testing were some minor revisions to the front wing flaps. The upper-most flap has been cut more aggressively downards at the inboard region and the sixth element at the outboard edge of the wing now spans across it entirely. This adjustment is aimed at finetuning the Y250 vortex and increasing the efficiency of the wing at low/medium speed. Finally, the small flick-up vane behind the cascade winglets has been split into two elements for more precise management of airflow.
Lotus are still adjusting to life with Mercedes power, which ‚Äì combined with a decent aerodynamic overhaul on the new E23 ‚Äì means it could be a while before results from the new partnership come about.
Having run most of testing with botched bodywork in some minor areas, the complete rear brake duct assembly will have been a welcome gain for the team in Australia. Not only will this have improved brake temperature management but also some additional downforce downforce applied directly to the rear tyre.
The best thing about the start of the new season is that we finally get to see some pictures of the cars in the pitlane without bodywork on ‚Äì there are no hoardings for the teams to hide behind! We already knew that Williams and Force India were more than likely to retain their air-to-air intercooler (IC) layout from 2014 and Lotus have also followed this pathway for this year. I still find it pretty interesting that Mercedes are the only one to use an air-to-water IC of all the supplied teams.
The renewed McLaren-Honda continues to disappoint (for now), although their aero programme is beginning to show a few signs of improvement.
A number of new bits appeared across the MP4-30 including a neat pair of under-chassis vanes. These vanes are often updated to tweak the position of the Y250 vortex and manage airflow passing underneath the nose, so they have a profound effect on linking the front and rear aero structures. The new vanes have three curled elements, with upturned slots to entice airflow through them.
Work on the radically different front wing continued in Australia with plenty of flo-vis runs carried out during free practice. Both Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen tried two options, one with extended cascades and revised upper flaps, the other without (i.e. the testing wing).
At the rear the central rear wing has been extended through the engine cover and down onto the top of the gearbox case, effectively forming a Y-lon arrangement. Although this is heavier it will provide better structural stiffness to the rear wing and prevent unwanted flexing.
Seeing Ferrari near the top of the speed trap figures is a welcome change over their miserable 2014. Certainly the power unit is a major step in the right direction and the fact that Sauber are also up in the points despite only a few changes to their chassis justifies this.
A new front wing was brought to the final test, which they continue to use into the beginning of the season. James Allison‚Äôs design influence is starting to really show in this area whilst they have also borrowed a few design ideas from Mercedes.
The nose camera pods (1) are not as curved as the original test item following an FIA directive to make these more ‚Äúminimal‚Äù for 2015. Instead they form a vertical stalk and a nicely formed dog-leg onto the nose to manage airflow over the top of the chassis.
Having produced their own unique solution of the past few years, the cascade winglets (2) have stepped towards what most of the field is using today ‚Äì a twin element winglet accompanied by and r-shaped vane to turn airflow around the front tyre.
Also like other teams, a curved pressure gradient vane (3) has been placed on the wing‚Äôs endplate to generate a low pressure region behind and draw airflow from out behind the wing elements. This is not a very efficient way of producing downforce but it will help the outwash of airflow at the front of the car, which can be combined with the effect of the blown front axle.

slot game 100 free spinsÔºåtaboo! taboo!Now, if it were not conscious considerations like the really benevolent or neutral ones first mentioned above, it was certainly something akin to them, which had induced Pierre to return a straightforward, manly, and entire acceptance to his cousin of the offer of the house; thanking him, over and over, for his most supererogatory kindness concerning the pre-engagement of servants and so forth, and the setting in order of the silver and china; but reminding him, nevertheless, that he had overlooked all special mention of wines, and begged him to store the bins with a few of the very best brands. He would likewise be obliged, if he would personally purchase at a certain celebrated grocer's, a small bag of undoubted Mocha coffee; but Glen need not order it to be roasted or ground, because Pierre preferred that both those highly important and flavor-deciding operations should be performed instantaneously previous to the final boiling and serving. Nor did he say that he would pay for the wines and the Mocha; he contented himself with merely stating the remissness on the part of his cousin, and pointing out the best way of remedying it.For instance, there are some who say, that it is unjust to punish any one for the sake of example to others; that punishment is just, only when intended for the good of the sufferer himself. Others maintain the extreme reverse, contending that to punish persons who have attained years of discretion, for their own benefit, is despotism and injustice, since if the matter at issue is solely their own good, no one has a right to control their own judgment of it; but that they may justly be punished to prevent evil to others, this being an exercise of the legitimate right of self-defence. Mr. Owen, again, affirms that it is unjust to punish at all; for the criminal did not make his own character; his education, and the circumstances which surround him, have made him a criminal, and for these he is not responsible. All these opinions are extremely plausible; and so long as the question is argued as one of justice simply, without going down to the principles which lie under justice and are the source of its authority, I am unable to see how any of these reasoners can be refuted. For, in truth, every one of the three builds upon rules of justice confessedly true. The first appeals to the acknowledged injustice of singling out an individual, and making him a sacrifice, without his consent, for other people's benefit. The second relies on the acknowledged justice of self-defence, and the admitted injustice of forcing one person to conform to another's notions of what constitutes his good. The Owenite invokes the admitted principle, that it is unjust to punish any one for what he cannot help. Each is triumphant so long as he is not compelled to take into consideration any other maxims of justice than the one he has selected; but as soon as their several maxims are brought face to face, each disputant seems to have exactly as much to say for himself as the others. No one of them can carry out his own notion of justice without trampling upon another equally binding. These are difficulties; they have always been felt to be such; and many devices have been invented to turn rather than to overcome them. As a refuge from the last of the three, men imagined what they called the freedom of the will; fancying that they could not justify punishing a man whose will is in a thoroughly hateful state, unless it be supposed to have come into that state through no influence of anterior circumstances. To escape from the other difficulties, a favourite contrivance has been the fiction of a contract, whereby at some unknown period all the members of society engaged to obey the laws, and consented to be punished for any disobedience to them; thereby giving to their legislators the right, which it is assumed they would not otherwise have had, of punishing them, either for their own good or for that of society. This happy thought was considered to get rid of the whole difficulty, and to legitimate the infliction of punishment, in virtue of another received maxim of justice, volenti non fit injuria; that is not unjust which is done with the consent of the person who is supposed to be hurt by it. I need hardly remark, that even if the consent were not a mere fiction, this maxim is not superior in authority to the others which it is brought in to supersede. It is, on the contrary, an instructive specimen of the loose and irregular manner in which supposed principles of justice grow up. This particular one evidently came into use as a help to the coarse exigencies of courts of law, which are sometimes obliged to be content with very uncertain presumptions, on account of the greater evils which would often arise from any attempt on their part to cut finer. But even courts of law are not able to adhere consistently to the maxim, for they allow voluntary engagements to be set aside on the ground of fraud, and sometimes on that of mere mistake or misinformation.If practical trial is necessary to test the capabilities of Communism, it is no less required for those other forms of Socialism which recognize the difficulties of Communism and contrive means to surmount them. The principal of these is Fourierism, a system which, if only as a specimen of intellectual ingenuity, is highly worthy of the attention of any student, either of society or of the human mind. There is scarcely an objection or a difficulty which Fourier did not forsee, and against which he did not make provision beforehand by self-acting contrivances, grounded, however, upon a less high principle of distributive justice than that of Communism, since he admits inequalities of distribution and individual ownership of capital, but not the arbitrary disposal of it. The great problem which he grapples with is how to make labor attractive, since, if this could be done, the principal difficulty of Socialism would be overcome. He maintains that no kind of useful labor is necessarily or universally repugnant, unless either excessive in amount or devoid of the stimulus of companionship and emulation, or regarded by mankind with contempt. The workers in a Fourierist village are to class themselves spontaneously in groups, each group undertaking a different kind of work, and the same person may be a member not only of one group but of any number; a certain minimum having first been set apart for the subsistence of every member of the community, whether capable or not of labor, the society divides the remainder of the produce among the different groups, in such shares as it finds attract to each the amount of labor required, and no more; if there is too great a run upon particular groups it is a sign that those groups are over-remunerated relatively to others; if any are neglected their remuneration must be made higher. The share of produce assigned to each group is divided in fixed proportions among three elements‚Äïlabor, capital, and talent; the part assigned to talent being awarded by the suffrages of the group itself, and it is hoped that among the variety of human capacities all, or nearly all, will be qualified to excel in some group or other. The remuneration for capital is to be such as is found sufficient to induce savings from individual consumption, in order to increase the common stock to such point as is desired. The number and ingenuity of the contrivances for meeting minor difficulties, and getting rid of minor inconveniencies, is very remarkable. By means of these various provisions it is the expectation of Fourierists that the personal inducements to exertion for the public interest, instead of being taken away, would be made much greater than at present, since every increase of the service rendered would be much more certain of leading to increase of reward than it is now, when accidents of position have so much influence. The efficiency of labor, they therefore expect, would be unexampled, while the saving of labor would be prodigious, by diverting to useful occupations that which is now wasted on things useless or hurtful, and by dispensing with the vast number of superfluous distributors, the buying and selling for the whole community being managed by a single agency. The free choice of individuals as to their manner of life would be no further interfered with than would be necessary for gaining the full advantages of co-operation in the industrial operations. Altogether, the picture of a Fourierist community is both attractive in itself and requires less from common humanity than any other known system of Socialism; and it is much to be desired that the scheme should have that fair trial which alone can test the workableness of any new scheme of social life.
Since tech businesses have numerous functionalities, it‚Äôs not exactly wise to categorize them all into one batch when it comes to WordPress themes. However, that‚Äôs why so many theme developers have put together solutions that allow for the ultimate customization. Looking for a tech theme brings up some questions. Most notably, what should you look for in a technology theme? To start, all of the listings below are responsive, and they have lightweight builds with speed in mind. In addition, you‚Äôll find options for pricing tables, eCommerce, service listings and email collecting. Knowledge bases and forums are common for IT companies, while you‚Äôre always going to want at least the option of having a blog.
Who Might Find These Tech and Hosting Options Useful?
This one is a little obvious, but the whole point of these themes is to generate websites with modern looks and the functionality for selling and displaying products and services. Therefore, IT, hosting and tech businesses are the obvious choices when thinking about who might find the following themes useful. However, we must also think about some other companies like app developers, freelance designers, software companies and the many other brands that make up this space.
The Nucleus WordPress theme offers a solid start to this list because it‚Äôs a multipurpose theme. We say this because it‚Äôs often tricky trying to find the ultimate solution for all tech and IT companies. With Nucleus, you have the opportunity to design a website the way you want, but it also caters to the world of technology with certain design elements, icons and typography. First of all, you receive a wide range of premium integrations and plugins, such as the Master Slider plugin for showcasing deals, products and new services. The Visual Composer plugin is packaged in with your purchase for dragging and dropping elements on the backend, while the WooCommerce plugin goes well with the Nucleus theme if you‚Äôd like to start collecting money from customers.
With the Nucleus WordPress theme you get to start with six premade homepages, each of which enable you to begin your design without a blank slate. For example, one of them is for an app landing page showcase, while another works nicely for a startup landing page. The responsive design works well on all mobile devices, which is particularly important for boosting your SEO and giving tech customers a chance to contact you while they‚Äôre on the go. Each of the demos have their own little features and perks. For example, one of them is built for conferences and events. You gain access to a countdown timer, along with a module for listing off all of the speakers who are going to be at the event. Overall, the Nucleus WordPress theme is an impressive match for the tech world, with an impressive set of demos and features.
Try out the 3D Printing WordPress theme if you‚Äôre looking for both a responsive and elegant technology option. Although the developers say that it‚Äôs made for 3D printing companies, just about any type of business in the tech sector could have a go at this one. It all starts with the Visual Composer plugin, which allows you to drag and drop elements without touching a line of code. In addition, the Revolution slider plugin is there if you‚Äôd like to feature some image slides at the top of your site. The unique design comes with free updates throughout the life of your site, and you‚Äôll find that the wide and boxed width settings get you started with some simple customizations. The unlimited color presets are impressive, as they can certainly help out with branding.
Keep in mind that the 3D Printing theme allows for an online store, so if you‚Äôd like to sell and collect money for your products, it‚Äôs all done through the theme and potentially an eCommerce plugin like WooCommerce. A parallax effect is prominent in the background, so when a user scrolls down on the page they see the slow movements of your backgrounds to keep the eyes on the most important content. Along with a contact form, the 3D Printing theme comes with a beautiful gallery/portfolio. We like this particularly for those companies that need to show off their past work, since the thumbnail imagery is enough to convince potential clients. As a final note, the theme provides some impressive blog layouts and demo content. This way you don‚Äôt need to worry about starting from scratch, and the design process will be that much faster.
Consider the Arlo Tech & Digital Business Theme if you‚Äôre interested in a fresh look for your technology business. The multipurpose option gives you an impressive number of demos to get your feet wet, while the gradient slider is pretty easy to manage when you have announcements that all of your site visitors should see. This is a full responsive theme for the best viewing experience on all devices, and the interactive dots background effect is sure to bring eyes to the content that matters most. You get to use the Visual Composer editor plugin, which is by far the best solution on the market. No coding is required, which is particularly useful for beginners with no coding experience. Not to mention, the WooCommerce plugin combines well with the Arlo Tech & Digital Business Theme, turning your site into a beautiful online store.
There are some parallax effects that we‚Äôve noticed on the demo, so if you‚Äôd like that to occur on your header then you shouldn‚Äôt have any problems at all. In addition, the header/slider provides a simple overlaying button and text module, which we enjoy for announcing new products or inserting a call to action. Since you get so many demos with the Arlo Tech & Digital Business Theme, we would like to outline just a few of them. For example, one of them is built just for a product showcase. Another demo has the functionality for displaying your app and getting people to download it. Some of the other demos include a Vcard, portfolio, portfolio with parallax effect, a simple business demo and more. It‚Äôs a solid theme for quite a few business types out there, so give it a try.
The ProHost WordPress theme delivers an impressive number of features for hosting companies. The modern and functional option provides lots of shortcodes for you to play around with. For example, if you‚Äôd like to insert a button or column on your homepage, you generally only have to grab a shortcode, eliminating the need to create your own custom CSS. The Visual Composer is yet another handy tool for optimizing your website and speeding up the development process. This is a fully responsive theme that looks just wonderful on tablets, phones and computers. This functionality is only going to help you out with the search engines, and we‚Äôre certain your customers will find it pleasing to the eye as well. The two homepage layouts are rather similar to what you would see on any hosting site, with a slider and large call to actions that announce what the hosting pricing looks like. You‚Äôll also find a spot to show pricing plans, for when people would like to signup.
The translation options are rather useful as well, considering so many of the customers that come in for a hosting company are not necessarily going to speak English. Along with that, the ProHost WordPress theme boasts a unique media content manager for when companies need to keep track of imagery and make sure it‚Äôs always the right size. WooCommerce also combines nicely with the theme, allowing for you to collect payments from customers who want hosting from you. We talked about shortcodes a little bit above, but the true outlying feature comes in the form of a shortcode builder, which is handy for when you need to create a somewhat unique webpage element without generating your own custom CSS. For example, image formatting and buttons are generally possible through a shortcode builder.
The Future 16 WordPress theme enables you to get your digital technology business off the ground. It comes with the Revolution Slider plugin, and all of the elements on the website looks wonderful on mobile devices. The drag and drop page builder is enough to speed up the development process for both beginners and advanced users, while the unlimited color and background solutions are essential when trying to brand your site and turn it into something a little more unique. The responsive design looks nice on all devices, and you‚Äôre bound to love the WooCommerce integration, since it‚Äôs just about the easiest plugin implementation you‚Äôll stumble upon.
Overall, the Future 16 WordPress theme has quite a bit to offer. Along with a modern design, shortcode generator and several custom widgets for placing in your footer, it‚Äôs one of the broader themes that any tech company could work with.
You can‚Äôt create tech websites by following the conventional approach. Rather, you need specialized templates like IT company for developing fully featured IT and technology sites. As the theme supports several post types and formats, you can publish different types of content. The powerful admin panel includes the necessary options to control the appearance.

You can use both photos and videos in the integrated full-screen slider. The real-time customizer allows you to make various changes and check out the output at the same time.

Spring is an excellent time to clean and repair pool fences, ensuring they are in a tip-top condition before summer.
Not only do you want your pool fence to look great, you also want to be certain there aren‚Äôt any potential problems that relate to safety, like broken latches or upright posts that have rotted or been unseated or have become misaligned.
Swimming pool fences are manufactured from the full range of fencing materials including wood, PVC, metal, and chain link. Irrespective of the material used, the design and manufacture must comply with state, county, and/or local authority laws, by-laws, and regulations. These are designed to prevent children, animals, and non-swimmers from gaining access to pools when they aren‚Äôt in use. Most importantly, if the design incorporates horizontal slats, these must not form a ‚Äúladder‚Äù that anyone could use to climb over the fence.
In Georgia, residential pool fences must be at least 4 foot high and no more than 4 inches off the ground. Openings must not be any bigger than 4 inches in diameter, and gaps between vertical slats may not be wider than 1¬º inches. Chain link fencing may not have openings that are larger than 1¬º square inches. Horizontal slats must be at least 45 inches apart or on the pool side of the fencing.
Gates must open outwards and must be both self-closing and self-latching.
If repairs are necessary, it is essential that the approved design is maintained. For instance, if upright posts are leaning out of alignment, you can‚Äôt just brace these with additional horizontal rails. If the latch doesn‚Äôt close properly it will need to be replaced.
A good spring clean should start with a thorough examination of the fencing. Look for dirt and fungal or algae growth as well as structural damage.
Mold and algae are more likely to form on painted or vinyl surfaces. Remove with a household detergent or proprietary cleaner.
Mud and sand can be hosed off. Do this before checking for wear and tear or damage.
Check wooden posts for rot just above ground level. If the post isn‚Äôt absolutely firmly embedded, and moves when pushed, there might be rot below the surface of the ground. This will require urgent action, although you might be able to replace just the rotten part and bolt and brace a shorter post to the bottom of the old one.
Check the alignment of posts using a spirit level to make sure they are still plumb and square. Wind, frost, and unstable or very soft soil can all affect posts over time. The state of any badly aligned posts will determine whether they need to be replaced or simply reset in concrete.
Check for loose rails and siding. If the fence is covered with plants, make sure that shoots, tendrils, and even small branches haven‚Äôt started to work their way into the fence structure. Again, it may be possible to repair some elements while others might need to be replaced.
If the fence is painted check for bubbles, blisters, and peeling paint. These sections should be scraped and then patched with new paint. If a painted pool fence has been allowed to deteriorate, the whole structure may need to be stripped and repainted.
Wooden fences that have been stained and/or sealed should be resealed annually.
Check metal fences for rust. This can usually be scraped, sanded, or removed with a commercial product. These areas should be recoated with a rust-resistant finish.
Check chain link fences for holes or other damage.
If you maintain your pool fence regularly, chances are there will only be minor cleaning and repair work required this spring. But sometimes major repair work is needed, in which case call the Georgia-based Natural Enclosures Fence Company for advice and a free quote!
Alfred Barnard was the author of a four-volume work entitled Noted Breweries of Great Britain and Ireland, (1889-91). He conducted his research by visiting each of the breweries and seeing at first hand how work was carried out. Barnard was particularly excited to start his tour of breweries with Guinness‚Äôs which he describes as ‚Äòthe largest and most renowned brewery in Europe‚Äô. Over a period of ten days he ‚Äòwitnessed on a grand scale, the manipulation of malt, and its manufacture into porter‚Äô.
Seven chapters of Barnard‚Äôs work are devoted to the Guinness Brewery, suggesting its importance in the worldwide brewing industry. Indeed, writing in 1889, Barnard commented that ‚Äòthe business is now the largest in the world, and the buildings in which it is carried on cover nearly forty-two acres of ground.‚Äô At the time of Barnard‚Äôs visit to the brewery, Claude Guinness was the Managing Director.
The overwhelming picture is one of a company that had been an international player since 1825, was at the cutting edge of the brewing industry and employed a vast number of staff. According to Barnard, ‚ÄòThe average number of hands employed in the establishment, which besides labourers, artisans, brewers, maltmen and engineers, includes clerks and managers of departments, is 2,650 persons, representing the working inhabitants of a town with a population of upwards of 6,000.‚Äô Therefore a huge percentage of the Dublin population was employed at the brewery.
The team at Guinness‚Äôs demonstrated a paternalistic approach towards its employees, something which is still remembered to this day. Barnard describes Belview and Rialto, two villages that were erected by Messrs. Guinness & Co. for their workmen. The populations were ‚Äòupwards of 350 persons‚Äô and ‚Äòupwards of 400 persons‚Äô respectively. The standard of living in these villages was very good for the time.
Likewise, the families of the Guinness workers tended to be well looked after. ‚ÄòWe were informed that all sorts of benefit and building clubs are well supported by the men, and that good provision is also made for them by the company in case of sickness, and to the widows after their husbands‚Äô death‚Äô. Being a worker at the Guinness Brewery was considered to be an honour.
Two types of porter were created in the brewery: plain porter (single stout) which Barnard equated to London porter, and double stout which in England was known as bottled stout. The raw materials used water included water, barley, hops and yeast. The water used to make the stout was the moderately hard water from the Grand Canal. (The softer water from Dublin‚Äôs other water supply, the river Vartry, was better suited for boilers and other processes). While some of the barley used in the brewing process was from Ireland, Guinness‚Äôs also imported barley from England, Scotland and elsewhere. The majority of hops were sourced from Kent in England but some were also imported from Germany and America.
Barnard explains in some depth the various processes and machinery used. He was particularly impressed with Guinness‚Äôs narrow-gauge railway system, commenced in 1873 and completed in 1877. Barley was delivered by train to the malt-houses where malting would be carried out between the months of September and May. Once the barley had been steeped, floored and kiln dried, the resulting malt would be emptied into the railway‚Äôs malt wagons and transported to the malt stores at St. James‚Äô Gate. When required by the mills, the malt transported from the stores to the mills by rail, as were the finished product ‚Äì the casks of stout ‚Äì which were delivered to Victoria Quay where they would be offloaded onto barges. Empty casks were also offloaded from barges by crane and loaded onto the railway wagons.
In all, Barnard devotes over forty pages to his description of the Guinness Brewery as it was in 1889, which is of interest to anyone researching the history of the St. James‚Äô Gate Brewery, brewing in general or anyone who may have had a family member working there. There are also a number of black and white illustrations (some of which have been included in this article) which complement his descriptions.

‚ÄôTis the season to buy and exchange not only books but also the kind of book-related tat and ephemera ‚Äì including Penguin mugs, bookshop T-shirts, tote bags, typewriter-key jewellery, Jane Austen notelets and novelty socks ‚Äì that at any other time of the year you wouldn‚Äôt consider giving house room to.
Pre-eminent this year among the items that you will soon to be regifting or taking to the Save the Children shop is The Grumpy Guide to Life: Observations from Grumpy Cat (Chronicle). Grumpy Cat is ‚Äì of course ‚Äì an internet sensation. And she is, just in case you haven‚Äôt been paying enough attention to Reddit, Facebook and all of the other contemporary heralds and signs of wonder ‚Äì a grumpy-looking cat. There‚Äôs a movie, apparently ‚Äì beware! ‚Äì and a lot of merchandise. The book consists of Grumpy Cat looking grumpy, with captions offering hilarious demotivational advice. ‚ÄúStrangers Are Just Enemies You Haven‚Äôt Met Yet‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Longest Journeys Start with a Single Step. Best Not to Take Any‚Äù etc. I was about to throw the book in the bin, despairing entirely of the state of modern civilisation, when my children pointed out that I look and sound exactly like Grumpy Cat. So at least I know what I‚Äôm getting for Christmas.
For anyone who attempts to offload Grumpy Cat on you, it would be easy to retaliate with something like Rick Chillot‚Äôs How to Make Your Baby an Internet Celebrity (Quirk), or perhaps Andy Donaldson‚Äôs Terrible Estate Agent Photos (Square Peg). Don‚Äôt ‚Äì although the latter does have the obvious advantage of being actually funny and wins hands‚Äëdown the toilet book captions-of-the-year competition.
2014 will of course be remembered as the year that saw the Russian intervention in Ukraine, the rise of Islamic State in Iraq, terrible events in Syria and Ebola in west Africa. It will also doubtless be remembered as the year in which we reached peak beard. It is therefore perhaps a little too late for the British Library to be offering a reprint of Thomas S Gowing‚Äôs The Philosophy of Beards, first published in 1854, but the book might serve as a nice memento for some recently clean-shaven hipster.
As they rediscover their newly hair‚Äëless chin the hipster in your life might enjoy a couple of literary chin‚Äëstrokers, such as The Biographical Dictionary of Literary Failure, edited by CD Rose (Melville House), and Haruki Murakami‚Äôs The Strange Library, first published in Japan in 2008 and now translated into English for the first time (Harvill Secker). It‚Äôs difficult to make head or tail of either of these books, which are therefore guaranteed to last until Boxing Day and beyond. Even more delightfully perplexing is Hans Eijkelboom‚Äôs People of the Twenty-First Century (Phaidon), which features page after page of themed photographs ‚Äì a page of men in Cairo wearing stripey jumpers, for example, women in Nairobi wearing floral prints, and men in New York wearing T-shirts. A kind of Where‚Äôs Wally? for adults, minus Wally.
Speaking of which, anytime is of course a good time to read a Terry Pratchett, but it‚Äôs perhaps only at Christmas that one might one indulge in a collection of essays such as Jacob M Held and James South‚Äôs Philosophy and Terry Pratchett (Palgrave). Who could resist a book that includes an essay on ‚ÄúCapitalism, Socialism, and Democracy on the Discworld‚Äù? Other inexplicably irresistible and uncategorisable Christmas fare includes Reggie Chamberlain-King‚Äôs Weird Belfast (Blackstaff), a compendium of weird facts about a city that might rightly claim to be weirder than any other, and Mel Gooding‚Äôs Art Rules! (and How to Break Them) (Redstone). Don‚Äôt buy these books as gifts: keep them for yourself. Ditto the gorgeous book bags, hoodies, badges and goodness knows what else available from all of the remaining independent bookshops up and down the country, such as NoAlibis (noalibis.com), the Book Hive (thebookhive.co.uk) and Much Ado Books (muchadobooks.com).
Finally, as one considers yet another pointless and wasted year, it might be time to consider giving it all up and joining the new age travellers who are beautifully portrayed in Iain McKell‚Äôs The New Gypsies (Prestel). If Jesus really was born in a stable, he‚Äôd have been right at home among the wild-eyed and the dentally challenged people photographed by McKell. He would also doubtless have identified with the many neglected, overlooked and forgotten people in Jenny Volvovski, Julia Rothman and Matt Lamothe‚Äôs The Who, the What and The When (Chronicle), which is an account of the lives of the friends, mentors, mothers, brothers, aunts, sidekicks and also-rans of history. Spare a thought for Jack Sendak, brother of the more famous Maurice, for Tom Thumb‚Äôs wife and for the Carter Family‚Äôs guitar teacher. We can‚Äôt all be Andy Warhol, but we may yet be a Julia Warhola. Personally, I‚Äôd rather be Emily Dickinson‚Äôs dog than Grumpy Cat.
About a month ago the hubby and I decided to rent a storage space for all the stuff we just can't seem to part with but have no actual use for. Well, we started separating everything and deciding on what would stay and go and in the process JD's room became the dumping ground for everything; my hubby's old nursing books, clothes for donation, outgrown toys, boxes and laundry. I couldn't believe that a room that was once so organized and peaceful, now looked like a tornado had hit it. So last weekend I finally couldn't take it anymore and spent two days getting everything back to normal, including finally putting JD's crib back in his room (he's never actually slept in his own room until now). I thought twice about posting these pictures because honestly they are pretty embarrassing, but I think they're a great way to ensure we never let it get that bad again and best of all, now I can start working on Robot Decor!
It was, but I do feel so much better, I would literally cringe every time I passed by that room! When JD saw it he was so excited to finally get to play in his own room again!
Looks great! It's all nice and neat!

Although I didn‚Äôt manage to get good shots of the Harlequin Ducks at Ft. Flagler due to the heavy fog, I did get some great shots of them after we stopped for lunch and some store-hopping in Port Townsend. Although I‚Äôve gotten better shots once or twice when I could get closer to them, the lighting was as good as I‚Äôve ever seen, with the sun breaking over my shoulder for a change. Though wary, the ducks were obviously used to people and went about catching food with only an occasional glance back at us.
even though the white patch on the male is too white, lacking details.
When I zoomed in on the male, the exposure was much better, even showing some of the small feathers behind the bill.
not to mention a chance to get slightly different profiles of the two males.
just because it‚Äôs not quite as beautiful as the picture next to it.
Truly beautiful images of such a stunning bird. I‚Äôve never seen a Harlequin, and these photos really give me a deep sense of what one looks like.
Recently I made a decision to update the laser computers from XP to Windows 7 (and update to X5 and wireless network while I was at it).
I'm not a complete stranger to upgrading and updating computers so I expected the process (for 2 computers) to take a day at max, and arranged the workflow to suit.
The Microsoft info. on upgrading assured me that the Windows Easy Transfer (WET) procedure would make the whole process quick and simple, and all I needed was a largish thumb drive.
After buying software I was ready to go. The WET file on comp 1 was 7 gig (!) and I started the transfer. Unfortunately the time required for the transfer to the thumb drive was calculated to be 7 and a half hours... This has rather blown my schedule. Comp 2 indicated 8.2 gig and 8 hours. A trip to a computer shop was undertaken and another drive obtained so that at least they could both be transferring at the same time. When I left work both drives were still transferring merrily (both are USB2 by the way) and had finished when I arrived the next morning.
It's now time to load software and the whole process went quite well. Updates downloaded (huge), Corel and Photoshop etc, printer drivers, email programs, registrations - time consuming, but all good.
The only problem was that WET failed miserably on both comps. A Google search indicated that this is not uncommon, and pointed to a couple of unofficial (and unsupported) MS workarounds that are amazingly complicated and have only a limited chance of success. Fortunately I had separate backups of around 10,000 Corel and Photoshop files, but more recent files were missing and emails and settings just disappeared. I really didn't think that I needed to bother doing a further backup because WET would take care of it.
If anybody here is thinking of upgrading to Windows 7 I would strongly recommend a full backup of everything, as well as totally ignoring the WET option.
While it wouldn't solve the problem of WET cocking up your systems, you would have saved a lot of time if you went with one of those USB hard drive docks (they usually go for about $30, I even got one free with the purchase of a hard drive). The Flash drive is great if the files to be transferred were large (like CAB files), but every time Windows transfers a small file (think of all of the txt, bat, lnk, tmb thumbnail files, etc.), it has to read a partially filled data sector from Flash, add the new small file, erase that Flash sector, then write in the updated sector... windows isn't smart enough to bundle up a bunch of small files and write a full sector in one shot.
Want proof? Zip up about 500 megs worth of files and drag the one file onto the drive. Time it. Now find a bunch of small files (say 1,000 or more) that make up about 500 megs combined and drag those over... you'll be waiting a while. I learned long ago to zip everything into one file if I'm trying to transfer between machines.
Including inside placed components 6000Kg so over all Container weight 6000Kg.
Now at the time of lifting Container ISO corners should be contact with lifting hook.
My aim is in lifting condition i want to find the Stress and deformation on ISO corners and structure behavior also.
And what kind of constrains to be needed.
what i was done is..
is this correct procedure ????
And here i was given 2G 3G acceleration upwards because i think at lifting condition container feel some jerking moment so i given this 2G and 3G.is this correct ???
I don‚Äôt want to be that person. Or rather I don‚Äôt want to be seen as that person. Because I am not. Even saying grains makes me feel pretentious.
Maybe it‚Äôs just because I want to eat a cookie. Or maybe it‚Äôs because I know how bad it made me feel when people suggested I cut out gluten instead of taking my medication. Maybe that‚Äôs the person I am truly afraid of. It‚Äôs the same people that assume I am diabetic because I am overweight (I am not diabetic, it‚Äôs just an assumption.) Or a flake, instead of anxious. Or dramatic, instead of sensitive.
It‚Äôs about culpability. They don‚Äôt want you to skate on all the things you have done, the way you let yourself go, the deadlines you have missed, or the projects you‚Äôve abandoned. If gluten is to blame, then so are you. Because you don‚Äôt have the will power to stop. Which comes back to personal responsibility and the dreaded ‚Äúfomo,‚Äù or fear-of-missing-out. If I can claim bankruptcy on my failings, then why can‚Äôt they? Why am I getting a get out of jail free card when they can‚Äôt. Of course, what they don‚Äôt get is when you are mentally ill you never get out of jail. Never.
Personally I would love to be ‚Äúout of my mind.‚Äù I want that kind of crazy. I would love that kind of crazy. This kind of crazy‚Ä¶ this kind of crazy is like being chained to the worst version of yourself. And every time you feel free of it, she drags you back in.
But also the cookie. I really, really want a cookie.
Update: I ate the cookie. It wasn‚Äôt that great. So I stopped at just one. Progress.

Karachi, Pakistan - On the evening of April 24, 2015, Sabeen Mahmud, the director of The Second Floor, a beloved cafe and communal space in Karachi, was shot and killed.
Mahmud's murder, and the resounding question of who was responsible, made news within and outside Pakistan. Less than a month later, the authorities announced that they had a culprit: a 27-year-old man named Saad Aziz.
He was "a burger kid", explained one unnamed friend interviewed by the Pakistani newspaper The Express Tribune at the time of Aziz's arrest. "He was funny, acted in plays and danced."
In Pakistan, the label "burger kid" is a loaded one.
"The implications of being a 'burger' are that you are spoiled, and detached from what is going on in the country," says Monis Rahman, 45, the founder of Rozee.pk, Pakistan's biggest online jobs portal.
"A burger lives in a cocoon and is enamoured by things outside of Pakistan - by the West," Rahman explains. The word is often used to describe well-to-do Pakistanis who may have American or British-tinged accents after years spent studying or working outside Pakistan, he says.
"Fully dressed with matching accessories even for 8am classes at university, they always own the latest in fashion, cars and gadgets," is another definition suggested by The Express Tribune. "Their 'parties' mimic nightclubs in foreign countries since the poor souls don't have any clubs here and have to recreate the experience on their own."
"People who have stronger English-speaking skills and more international exposure are valued higher in the jobs market."
Since 2013, there has been a slow but steady evolution of the term "burger" beyond its pejorative context.
Former cricketer Imran Khan, the leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, was dismissed as a "baby boy or a burger boy" by older political leaders, while his supporters were called "burgers".
"It's the first time that the burger group will also come out to vote," quipped politician Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed before the elections in May 2013.
"They're going to join the chapati-and-salan [curry] folk. They might need to carry their laptops on their heads to protect them from the sun."
While Rasheed hinted that PTI supporters were more suited to campaigning on social media from the comfort of their homes, he made one crucial point: "If they do come out to vote, they'll do amazingly well."
An estimated 46.2 million people voted in these elections, compared with the 36.6 million voters from the previous 2008 elections. The 2013 election saw the highest voter turnout in Pakistan's history. Thirteen million were first-time voters and more than half the registered voters were aged 18-29.
Rasheed was proved right. Khan's base of young, educated urban "burgers" helped the PTI to emerge from the elections as the second most powerful political party in the country. With 7.7 million votes, the PTI knocked President Asif Ali Zardari's party, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), which garnered 6.9 million votes, from its perch and into third place.
PTI's burgers began to wear the label with pride; literally, in some cases, as the party's supporters turned up at rallies and on election day wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the words "Kaptaan's Burger Army" ("Kaptaan" is a moniker that pays tribute to Khan's time as captain of the Pakistani cricket team).
Originally from Lucknow in pre-partition India, Raza spent several years after partition in 1947 working in the Middle East.
Although he knew no one in Karachi when he arrived, his son, Ashfaq Raza, 53, says: "My father dreamed of starting up a business that would ensure people would know of us and know our family's name."
As his nine sons moved to the United States and England for their studies, Musa Raza, who is no longer alive, urged them to return to Karachi as soon as they could to start up a business.
Ashfaq's older brother, Iqbal, a flight engineer, travelled frequently to Europe and witnessed the arrival of McDonald's there in the 1970s. "He saw the long lines outside McDonald's restaurants and hit upon the idea of bringing the franchise to Pakistan," Raza says.
In 1978, the brothers approached the McDonald's corporation. They were promptly turned down. "They told us that Pakistan was not ready for burgers," Raza recalls.
They made an offer to Burger King who gave them the same answer.
"So we took that as a challenge," Raza explains. "We wanted to prove these multimillion-dollar chains wrong."
To learn the ropes, the brothers spent a few months working at a McDonald's near their family home in Hartford, Connecticut. At one point, Raza and five of his brothers worked at the same outlet.
Their colleagues did not know that they were there to soak up all the information they could about running a fast food enterprise.
"We even offered to work for no pay," says Raza, who spent three months at McDonald's while in high school.
The brothers were paid $1.80 an hour and worked their way up from cleaning the restrooms to learning to make the food, handle equipment and manage staff. In late 1978, the Raza brothers returned to Karachi and began testing burger recipes.
"Our friends warned us that this was a bad idea," Raza says. "At that time, there were no burgers in Pakistan - just bun kebabs." The bun kebab, a local variant of the burger, consists of a slender minced meat patty and a potato or lentil patty. Slapped inside a bun and garnished with a fried egg, onions, chillies and chutney, the bun kebab is a staple at roadside cafes or street vendors' carts and is gulped down in three or four bites. But the brothers didn't want to make what Raza refers to as this "poor man's burger".
"I'm sure many people told McDonald's in the 1950s that American households weren't interested in what they had to offer," Raza says. "But McDonald's changed the game. That's what we wanted to do - change the model of how and what people ate in Pakistan."
They spent three months perfecting a tender beef patty with a peppery spice and the slightly sweet "secret sauce" that cut out the need for what Raza calls "frills", like tomatoes or onions.
In the following months, the brothers laid down the foundation for Pakistan's first burger joint, and created a blueprint that would be replicated in hundreds of fast-food outlets in the country for years to come, its simplicity belying the mammoth task of creating an entirely novel approach to eating out.
The brothers were determined to source all the food products locally - this was to be a proudly Pakistani enterprise - and so while equipment had to be brought in from the US, everything from ketchup to straws and paper ramekins for sauce had to be made in the country.
"You won't believe it, but at that time, there was only one supplier in the country who made disposable cups, and it was selling them to the national airline only," Raza recalls. "They refused to sell the cups to us because they didn't think it was worthwhile and they didn't understand what we were trying to do." It took the family five years to convince the company to produce the 16-ounce cups Mr Burger needed.
Following the McDonald's model, the Raza brothers wanted to hire students to work at the outlet. But they did not anticipate the stigma associated with working in a kitchen.
"Kids from Karachi were embarrassed about getting a job at a restaurant and, moreover, they didn't want to do basic chores like cleaning the floor," Raza says.
Some employees would appeal to Raza - "I'm a Syed [families believed to be direct descendants of the Prophet Muhammad], how can I mop the floor?" Raza laughs at the memory now. "They didn't realise I am a Syed as well. I cleaned the floors and tables for two years until the employees came around to it."
One year later all that remained to be decided was the name. "There used to be a restaurant in Hartford named Mr Steak," Raza recalls. "When we were trying to come up with a name for our business, that name clicked."
And so, Mr Burger was born. "It was simple, easy to remember and whether someone was educated or not, it was easy to pronounce," Raza says.
His brother Iqbal, the flight engineer, travelled to Paris frequently and after the name was settled, he strolled down the Champs-Elysees and found an artist who sketched a logo for the business.
In 1980, the Raza brothers opened the doors of the first Mr Burger in Karachi's Nazimabad neighbourhood. They served five kinds of burgers - Mr Burger, Beef Burger, Chicken Burger, Egg Burger and Veggie Burger - for five rupees each (five cents today), French fries (Rs2) and flavoured slush (Rs2 a cup). The prices ensured that even students on shoestring budgets could buy a meal of fries and slush.
"Within minutes we had nearly 150 people crammed into this tiny space," Raza recalls. "People in the neighbourhood had been watching as the restaurant was being constructed and they were so curious about what we were selling that we didn't even need to advertise our opening - the news just spread through word of mouth."
The brothers did not just introduce a new food to Pakistani consumers - they served up the fast-food culture that they had seen in the US, one that a majority of Pakistanis had never been exposed to as international travel was a privilege reserved for the rich.
While some customers were annoyed that the restaurant only served burgers - "You won't believe how many people asked us why we didn't have nihari or biryani on the menu," Raza says - others wanted a taste of this "American food".
"They wanted to try it, but they were confused about how to eat a burger," Raza says. "Some would pick it apart and then use the bun as roti to scoop up bites of the patty." Raza and his brothers would then demonstrate how to unwrap the burger's paper covering, and pull it down halfway to form a pocket while eating.
Customers would sit at a table and holler at servers to bring their food over or get angry that they weren't being waited on, he recalls. "They had no clue about self-service, takeaway food or disposable items - people returned wrappers and cups to us until they learned they could throw leftovers in the trash."
Mr Burger's "no smoking policy" was an alien concept too. At the time, there was a marked shift in attitude towards more gun-toting as AK-47s, brought by Afghan refugees fleeing the Soviet invasion in their country, flooded the black market. "Some people - especially the big shots - would pull a gun on my employees if they asked them not to smoke inside the restaurant," Raza remembers. "They felt insulted."
Back then, the brothers couldn't find a Pakistani company making sliced cheese. "One of my customers walked in with a packet of Kraft cheese slices he bought in America," Raza says. "He was used to eating a burger with cheese abroad and that's what he wanted."
Raza tracked down a small company that manufactured butter and desi cheese or paneer in Sahiwal, Punjab. "They tasted the Kraft cheese and then spent months trying to make it," he explains. Once the taste mimicked the yellow plastic-wrapped Kraft slices, the suppliers proudly brought a large block of cheese to the restaurant.
"I looked at it and I said, 'What is this?' You see, they didn't have a slicer for the cheese," Raza says, laughing. They imported a cheese slicer from the US and taught the supplier how to use it.
So who came to Mr Burger? "Everyone," Raza says.
In the first 15 years of business, Nawaz Sharif, the current prime minister, used to come for the chicken burgers, as did former President Zardari, who at the time was Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's fiance.
During the day, queues would spill out of the restaurant and on to the street.
"Everyone, no matter how important or rich they were, had to get in line," he says. Initially, the space was a great equaliser. High-ranking police officials and businessmen briefly rubbed shoulders with students and labourers at Mr Burger. But soon, there was a return to the well-worn grooves between these classes.
"We had space for only four hanging tables - no chairs - inside the restaurant, so we'd clean and wash down a space outside where people could sit," Raza says. "Some movie stars, rich people and celebrities who wanted to avoid the aam aadmi [common man] began to come in after 10pm and would sit on this cleaned floor to eat their burgers."
While the fast food concept was new for a majority of people, it thrilled others to finally have access to a beloved staple of life outside Pakistan.
"Members of foreign consulates and diplomatic missions in Karachi were so happy they could finally have a burger here," Raza recalls. His first sweet taste of success came from these customers. "You are the McDonald's of Pakistan," they would tell him.
By the mid-1980s, there were five Mr Burger outlets in Karachi. The tantalising brush with American culture that Mr Burger offered trickled past the palate and into other parts of customers' lives in a way that Raza had not anticipated.
"Customers began objecting that the teenagers who came to Mr Burger were behaving in a very 'Westernised' way - they would come there for dates," Raza says. "The kids are sitting too close together, they are holding hands," he recalls customers complaining.
For Raza, this was a source of pride. "I felt very happy that this was a safe space for these teenagers," he says.
"To this day I have customers coming in with their wives and they tell me, 'Our first date was at Mr Burger'. Their children call me Uncle Burger."
And these "Westernised" customers were given a name: burgers.
According to Raza, the phrase was coined by Pakistani comedian Umer Shareef back in the 1980s. "He saw that people of a certain class and from certain well-off neighbourhoods such as Clifton and Defence would come to Mr Burger a lot and he started calling them 'burgers'," Raza claims.
In an interview last year, Shareef confirmed the term was used to describe people from this "certain class", and he used the analogy of food to describe "burgers" as distinct from the aam aadmi.
"[In the 1980s] I started noticing women in restaurants who were the kind of people to pick up a roti using a tissue paper," he said.
"We had never done anything like that, so I asked myself, 'What class do these women belong to?'" It was a class that preferred to align itself with the West, and behaved as though it did not even know how to eat a common roti, he implied.
By 1995, the Raza brothers were flipping more than 100,000 burgers a month. A year later, they received word that they were being "watched".
"Some of our customers told us that they had been employed to thoroughly research Mr Burger, to see how it had done so well in Karachi," Raza claims. McDonald's was coming to town, and Mr Burger was no longer the only option for Pakistanis in search of fast food.
In 1993, Pizza Hut was the first foreign franchise to land in Pakistan, followed by KFC in 1997 and McDonald's a year later.
Today, KFC reportedly has the largest share - 37 percent - of the fast-food market in the country, followed by McDonald's at 26 percent, while other foreign franchises have made inroads here too such as Hardees, with 6 percent of the market share.
For consumers under the age of 19, who accounts for 45 percent of Pakistan's population of more than 185 million, burgers have always been a part of life, whether by way of the small roadside kiosks or international brands.
In 2013, BIL Foods, the franchiser for Fatburger, predicted that demand for fast food will continue to grow and estimates a 30 percent increase in Pakistan by 2017.
Industry sources say that it is difficult to put a number on the market share for homegrown fast-food businesses, but they agree that it is swiftly growing to cater to the demand.
Shahvez Fazail, 33, for instance, founder of the online delivery service Food Genie, has signed on more than 60 burger chains in the last year, including Mr Burger, and of these, new local businesses outnumber the foreign entities.
One of Fazail's clients is Ali Raza, 38, owner of Burger Inc. Raza studied and worked in the US before returning to Karachi in 2004. He, like many fast-food restaurant owners in Karachi I spoke to, spent his formative years abroad where he got his first job. He believes that the local burger chain boom has arisen partly because of the lucrative growing demand, but also from a need to cater to consumers like himself - a generation that has been exposed to international fast food trends and franchises.
"Part of our personalities are very rooted in another culture," he explains. "Its not just those of us who have returned to Pakistan, though - everything is so accessible via the Internet and we travel so much now that we all want to be part of an international culture that we see so much of."
While those who have returned to Pakistan relish traditional food, they also crave American burgers, he says. That's where the local chains step in.
"The international brands are great, but they're all about convenience and volume," he explains. "They can nuke you a burger in three minutes, but I'll make it from scratch, with the freshest of ingredients and the best quality beef in the market."
Despite the friendship between Pakistan and the US being lukewarm at best over the past few years - a 2014 Pew Research Center poll found that 59 percent of Pakistanis view Americans unfavourably - our palate still takes its cues from the US.
Local burger chains try to offer the best of both worlds, bringing fresh, homegrown produce to a menu with a decidedly American flavour.
Naveed Savul, 47, the owner of Burger Lab, which he started nearly four years ago, also feels the local market is spurred on by food trends outside of Pakistan.
"We were very used to overly processed, synthetic-tasting fast food, but then we saw a change in the US and Europe - a return to organic, fresh cuts and locally sourced ingredients," he says.
In the years Burger Lab has been operating, Savul has noticed greater demand for "gourmet burgers" - burgers with blue or gouda cheese, for instance - which, costing more than Rs700 ($6.68) have become staples on restaurant and cafe menus, catering to customers with deep pockets. According to the consumer research firm Euromonitor International, the annual disposable income of Pakistanis increased by 23.1 percent between 2008 and 2013 and expenditure jumped by 24.5 percent.
"Unlike my generation, kids today have a lot of money and there's an entrenched culture of eating out or ordering in," says Raza of Burger Inc.
Since the day Mr Burger came to Pakistan, burgers - the food, the concept - have become harbingers of change.
"I feel so happy when I hear people using this term 'burgers'," Ashfaq Raza says, laughing. "It makes me think of Mr Burger. It reminds me of how people doubted us when we were starting out, but then called us pioneers, and began to follow us."
"The Pakistani market is very trend-oriented, but it's a small percentile of consumers who start these trends," says Savul, owner of Burger Lab. These consumers manage to spark something. "One definite reason for this demand for burgers is the idea that, 'The cool people are eating them'," Savul feels.
PTI and its supporters arguably hope to capitalise on the possibilities that such trendsetters offer, and perhaps redefine what it means to be a burger.
"I think that when they [critics] refer to us as 'burgers', they are talking about people who are from the educated class," says Arsalan Taj Ghumman, 30, the former president of the Karachi chapter of PTI's student wing, Insaf Students Federation.
"We have never been involved in corrupt politics, we aren't afraid to question what we are told and we don't believe that politics must be a game of fear and threats."
For Ghumman, it is a source of pride that the party was able to bring a generation of "burgers" into the fold.
"The most ignorant people are those who belong to the upper class in Pakistan," he says.
"They have been given every opportunity in life by God and they have everything that one could desire. It is very difficult to attract these kinds of people to political activism, and if PTI has done so, it is a big victory for the party."
When PTI's critics comment on the branded clothes that these party supporters wear, their income or accents, and use the word "burger" as a slur, Ghumman has a simple retort: "Would you call Mohammad Ali Jinnah a burger? He lived abroad, he was educated in London and he worked there, and he liked to dress a certain way. Can you call the founder of our country a 'burger'?"

For now, Harry is focusing on his charity work including his beloved Invictus Games.
The royal was incredibly proud when he found out 11 competitors from five nations who competed in the the 2014 or 2016 Invictus Games will once again represent their country later this month at the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games.
Taking to Twitter, Harry, the patron of the Invictus Games Foundation, shared his best wishes.
‚ÄúI remember watching these competitors at the 2014 and 2016 Invictus Games."
"And now they've been selected for the Rio Paralympic Games. I can't think of a better example of showing how important sport can be for recovery."
‚ÄúI know they'll compete with the same Invictus spirit that we saw in London and Orlando ‚Äì motivated not just by winning, but by pushing their bodies and minds to the absolute limit to prove to the world there is life beyond injury."
‚ÄúThey will lift everyone around them and whether you're watching in Rio or on TV around the world, they will inspire you. I'm incredibly proud of what they've achieved and will be cheering on every single competitor during the Games."
Prince Harry and Michelle Obama are proud Invictus supporters.
Addressing the 11 competitors directly, he added, ‚ÄúTo those Invictus Games competitors representing your five nations, all I have to say to you is what an incredible achievement ‚Äì well done for your selection.
"You have trained harder than ever, but the fight to the finish line won't be easy. You all know this better than anyone. Cherish this moment as you get to serve your country again.
"Absorb the applause and atmosphere for inspiring millions, but most importantly - have fun!"

"Young people with melanoma are relatively unusual, even in this relatively unusual disease. Most individuals are older. I myself have never had a patient with melanoma quite that young, nor can I say a melanoma that was quite so difficult to treat, as Joe."
"Keeping it under wraps, not telling friends...I can't imagine how difficult that had to be for him, because he had to have read the papers that said 'what's the matter with Joe Roth? Why did he have a day like this?' And how badly could he have wanted to say, 'you know what I'm going through? You know, I've got cancer. I may not live. I don't know what's going to happen to me.' But he never said that. He never looked for excuses."
"I think he was sideswiped by it coming back, but in true Joe Roth fashion, it's like a blindside blitz. He shook it off, stood up and went to the next play. He didn't blink."
"That disease is something where you've got to put up or shut up and declare yourself. Joe knew he was being tested and that he was being asked to fight a battle that maybe no one had ever fought the same way."
"He wasn‚Äôt feeling good at Christmas (1976), but he put on his running clothes and said, 'I want to go for a run and I want to just keep running and running.' What can you say? There‚Äôs nothing you can say."
I think we all know who are these two guitar players. Joe Morris has been one of the most intriguing guitar voices in improvised music for a while now. An original and always inspired musician I think he is one of the few who doesn‚Äôt play generic guitar music, having adapted precepts, concepts, and even phrases from musicians who play piano, saxophone, and other instruments.
Mary Halvorson is an avant-garde jazz guitarist from Brookline, Massachusetts. Even if she is often categorized as a jazz guitarist, her music includes elements of many other genres, such as flamenco, rock, noise, and psychedelia. I‚Äôve been waiting for this record for a long time. Being an admirer of both, I enjoyed the news of this record where I finally had the chance to listen to them both. I was not disappointed. Being two of the most innovative guitarists in circulation this album could not fail to represent a moment of exchange, innovation, deep interaction. The nine tracks that make up this cd are, in reality, nine moments of dialogue, exchange of ideas, interplay and pure creativity.
The thing that struck me the most was being able to listen to their styles, always so different, blend harmoniously in a set of free extended improvisation, tunes that run from just over two minutes in length, to past the ten minute mark. Both know each other very well. The result is perfect, a balanced mix of sounds, emotions and notes that seem to be born with a simple spontaneity. Traversing Orbits is a great record.

Thanks to oh so talented Zac Wolf Photography, we got to see beautiful wedding of Reilly + Rob. Reilly was one of the very last bride we worked with before leaving NYC for Lalaland so it's extremely special to see this wedding turn out so lovely! The bride is wearing our HB6285 wedding dress and her wedding took place this past summer at Thomson Island in Massachusetts.
Lila was among the last group of brides I had a pleasure of working with in NYC before the move back to LA. She wore our HB6285 dress and our tipped veil. And to see result of our encounter looking through beautiful pictures taken by Nicki at Denueva Photo warms my heart. Lila's loveliness is matched by her dashing new husband Aron. I wish these two couple lifetime of happiness.
Ionized water is filtered drinking water that has been ionized. Water Ionization separates the water molecules into base acidic and alkaline parts. This is done through electrolysis, which uses the naturally occurring electric charge found in minerals ions like magnesium and calcium. When water has become ionized, it can enhance the blood oxygen levels and act as a natural antioxidant that removes harmful and aging free radicals in your body.
A good Water Ionizer Machine can easily accomplish this for you. You will need water that hasn‚Äôt had the minerals removed, which means no Distilled Water (empty water) or Reverse Osmosis water, unless it has the natural minerals added back into the drinking water, which most newer units do now. The ionizer needs the minerals naturally present in water to supercharge it with electrical potential, and super hydrating water molecules. The health benefits are numerous!
These are not all the benefits, but the most common ones. I love using my water ionizer, the way it makes the water taste, as well as the benefits I get while exercising and experiencing optimum wellness personally. So, what is an Alkaline Water Ionizer Machine?
An Alkaline Water Ionizer Machine is the actual water purifier that takes ordinary tap water (or any other whole water source) and splits the water molecules into acid and alkaline (there are benefits of both types), adds electrical potential and makes the water molecule properly structured for maximum hydration and benefit to health.
Water Ionizers can be countertop units that sit near a sink faucet and have an input and output chambers. You can control the amount of alkalinity or acidity you desire. Extreme acidic or alkaline water is really good for cleaning. For drinking, cooking and rinsing, I use between 8.5 ‚Äì 9.5 pH, and save the acidic water that is also created for a good natural cleaning solution.
Portable Water Ionizers and Alkalizers make it easier to take your super water with you wherever you go. They are nowhere near as powerful as full countertop water ionizer units, but you can get one at a really good price. The Tygo Portable Water Ionizer by Tyent is a good inexpensive choice that improves the quality of you drinking water, gets rid of bad stuff that can make you sick, and adds the healthy stuff that makes you feel great and hydrated.
The best water ionizer machine right now is the Tyent line of alkaline water ionizers. I particularly like the ACE or MMP series, as it is the most powerful, with an anytime guarantee. The newest model is the ACE-11 Above Counter Water Ionizer. It got awarded 2016 Ionizer of the Year too! You can also get an under the counter model, if you want to preserve your counter space. It is the best health device you can ever own.
It‚Äôs probably the best thing you can do to improve your health and performance levels and make your life disease resistance too. Add in the longevity and anti-aging benefits, and I think you can see why I love these water ionizers so much. You can get $1,500 off for a limited time, and also get a free gift using the code: BigDeal, just visit: Tyent Ace Water Ionizers.
Cincinnati Police Chief James Craig has given notice he will not take the Ohio police certification test, which would be required for him to have police powers. This sounds bad to me. Why would he not just take the test? It's reportedly 200 questions. I don't know how hard of a test it is, but I would have presumed he could pass it quite easily. By him not wanting to take it leas me to assume it may be more difficult, thus his knowledge of Ohio laws may not be up to snuff, yet. That may be the reason for him not taking it. I'm just surprised this has become an issue for him to address at all. He should just take the test like every other police officer has to do. I understand he doesn't literally need police powers, but I think the Chief of police of Cincinnati should have the power to make an arrest if needed.
It make sense to me that it could be a potential morale boost, too.

Damage caused by contact with liquids is subject to potentially expensive reparation fees. Also, there are many cases where important data was not recoverable and thus lost. The following are some examples of problematic scenarios and how to handle them.
Water damage may be caused by the following.
Dropping the player into a washbasin, bathtub, toilet, water tank, etc.
NOTE: Thinner cloths, gasoline (benzene), or alcohol will damage the exterior finish of your player, therefore do not use those products.
Just a small amount of water may get into your player through tiny gaps. Repetition of extremely small amount of liquid contact caused by water drops or humidity inside the player will lead to internal components corrosion over time. Avoid using or leaving your player in an environment where temperature changes suddenly or a humid environment as much as you can.
Once the moisture gets into the body of your Walkman, the internal components may be corroded, or short-circuited. Also, the WM-PORT jack may be corroded, blue rust may appear as in the below image. In particular, if the moisture remains in the metal terminal part, it will cause the rust to appear and damage the player.
If you use a case, it is recommended to remove it and clean it up frequently. Dust collected between the case and the body of the player may retain humidity and cause damage.

Got about 100 photos scanned in 65 TIFF files (440 mb total) - need to separate them and crop them and name them appropriately. Scanfest was over at 2 p.m., but I scanned until 2:30.
* While in Scanfest chat, Best of the Genea-Blogs - January 24-30, 2010 posted (written last night, edited this morning).
* Edited my OASIS "Beginning Computer Genealogy" handout and presentation, and printed sufficient copies for the class which starts on Monday. Checked in on Facebook.
* Tami came, and we left at 4:45 p.m. to go to dinner at Rubio's. Michelle and Randy have had the grandgirls for two days, so they met us and we had an hour with Lolo and Audrey. They ate well, and were happy to see us. Tami took the girls home and we were home by 6:30 p.m. Watched some of the Pro Bowl game while Linda was on computer.
* Back online at 7:30 p.m., read everything, transferred data to two flash drives for the OASIS class. Wrote two posts for Monday, since I have to leave by 9 a.m. to the car dealer and then OASIS classroom. Wrote this post, and just realized I missed Desperate Housewives again. Drat.
Genealogy today was 7.0 hours - 0.5 hour doing email, 0.5 hour reading blogs, 0.5 hour on Twitter/Facebook, 2.0 hours writing blog posts, 2.5 hours on Scanfest, and 1.0 hour working on OASIS class stuff.
To say I have been more inspired than I am at this very moment in my life, would be a lie. I have never been in a room full of so many people that are determined to simply, get better. Everyone who came to this workshop had one goal ‚Äì to learn. I guess it‚Äôs easy to say you want to learn, however the way these people went about learning was so impressive. They not only bettered themselves, but took time to meet, help, and encourage all the other people they met that day. I am so happy to be a part oof this community.
It‚Äôs really hard to explain just how the workshop went. So luckily for you, and for me ‚Äì I had some of my friends ‚Äì Brandon and Jasmine join me ( and photograph it).
I did my first of what I know will be many more workshops this past weekend in San Diego. Well, I have done workshops before ‚Äì or rather I have taught people about Music Photography before. But this is the first time we straight up rented out a venue to ourselves. As you learn, you sometimes forget. And the things you forget can be really helpful to remember. So the best way for me to remember them ‚Äì is to teach them. I have gone back to my high school almost every year since I have graduated. My high school photography teacher has been a big contributor and mentor to me in my life, so it is always nice to go back and meet all of her students. Through that experience and a few others I have learned just how much I enjoy teaching.
Anyway the workshop was broken into two days. Intermediate and Advance. They had loosely the same schedule, however the content and goal that was taught each day was different. Each of them started with a two hour presentation, then we shifted to a venue for four hours, and then finished up in front of the screen for another hour and a half. The first day aimed at taking people who have been into music photography for awhile ‚Äì to the next level aka Concert Photography Level Up. The second day was geared on taking people who are well versed in concert photography already ‚Äì and giving them the tools and information to assist them with the task of getting on tour ‚Äì Becoming A Tour Photographer. This is a hard industry to navigate, and I want to help you. If you have any questions, want more info ‚Äì or want to be alerted when I come to your area.
Talk with the band ‚Äì Tanner of In Flames and Joey of The Used!
All in all it was a success. Thanks so much for everyone who came out. I look forward to doing this more and meeting more people.

The apocalypse is at the door of Alaska‚Äôs and America‚Äôs northernmost community. You can read about it on the internets.
Houses ‚Äúfloating inland for miles?‚Äù How exactly does that work? Are the houses in Barrow somehow different from the houses in the rest of the country that end up inundated by floods.
Do Barrow houses get up on their stilts and move crab-like across the tundra at high water, or are they like jack-up oil rigs? The houses are built to float and the owners only put the stilts down when they want to stop floating.
Jack-up houses would seem a natural for Alaska given all the fears about global warming and the rise of the oceans. If high water threatens your community, just prepare the house to set sail, ride away on the rising sea, and jack the house up wherever it stops.
A couple of people suggested a review of websites that feature Arctic construction.
There you will find that houses are not ‚Äúbuilt on stilts because of the impenetrability of permafrost‚Äù but built on pilings driven deep into the permafrost. The pilings for the new Public Heath Service Hospital in Nome, for instance, were ‚Äúdrilled 30 feet through permafrost and set in the bedrock,‚Äù according to an article in the 2007 ‚ÄúAlaska Contractor‚Äù magazine.
Pilings are driven or drilled into the permafrost to varying depths all across the Arctic these days. The practice appears to have started slightly before Alaska Statehood.
‚ÄúThere was no known widespread use of pile foundations in Arctic and subArctic Alaska prior to 1950,‚Äù according to a 1957 report written for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The military in Alaska began experimenting with wood, precast concrete, iron and other pilings in the early 1950s.
Water drilling, churn drilling, and power augering were all tried to create holes in permafrost (frozen ground) to allow piling placement.
It took about 4 minutes more to reach 16-feet.
Structures built atop pilings started to become an Arctic norm not long after these experiments. The Department of the Army in 1983 published a 269-page guide for building atop pilings. The manual called for buildings to be attached to the piles so that they would stay on the piles.
‚Äú‚Ä¶Researchers predict that by mid-century, the homes, schools and land around Barrow and its eight surrounding villages will be underwater,‚Äù the Post story says.
Sea levels could to rise 2 to 2.5 feet at most by 2050, according to the U.S. Global Change Research Program of the U.S. government. That could cause flooding in the Barrow area and put some land underwater, but not even the shortest homes or schools would be submerged.
Not to meniton that Barrow is about 15 feet above sea level at this time.
Barrow does, however, face legitimate climate-change threats as one of the few communities in the 49th state where temperatures have actually risen significantly in the last 50 years, according to the Alaska Climate Research Center at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
The PDO is an old phenomenon that describes the pooling of warm water in the Gulf of Alaska. That warm water influences the climate of the entire state. To date the PDO appears to have had a greater effect than climate change on most of Alaska with the exception of Barrow.
And in Barrow the problem isn‚Äôt so much warming as it is a seasonal shift. Winter now comes later to the North Slope than in the past. The late arrival means Barrow isn‚Äôt safely locked in ice by the time fall storms start raking across the 49th state.
And that, not the rising sea level, is what causes the real and immediate problem for Barrow.
‚ÄúThe dramatic decline in sea ice coverage in the autumn means that there is much more open water to the west and northwest of Barrow,‚Äù NOAA reports. ‚ÄúOn October 13-14, 2012, a strong storm, 500 miles northwest of Barrow, produced coastal flooding in low-lying parts of Barrow.
No houses went ‚Äúfloating inland for miles‚Äù in 2012, but some old timers in Barrow said there might have been some structures moved inland a distance, if not miles, in a big storm that brought high water in ‚Äô63.
The report makes no claim to houses floating miles away, but as with much of what is reported in the media today, it could have happened. Maybe.
The Post article was written for an innumerate non-technical audience about a place they will never see. It‚Äôs on script so the audience nods and adds Barrow to the list of things they are deep passionate about saving. From what I can tell climate concern seems to be an urban affliction based on a notion the planet should remain in its present state forever. True students of nature who observe things know that nature and the planet are dynamic. Great blog, one of the best on the interwebs!
there is indeed a 3 degree increase over the last 60 years, but what it means is hard to say. as The Alaska Climate Research Center notes: ‚ÄúConsidering just a linear trend can mask some important variability characteristics in the time series. The figure at right shows clearly that this trend is non-linear: a linear trend might have been expected from the fairly steady observed increase of CO2 during this time period. The figure shows the temperature departure from the long-term mean (1949-2014) for all stations. It can be seen that there are large variations from year to year and the 5-year moving average demonstrates large increase in 1976. The period 1949 to 1975 was substantially colder than the period from 1977 to 2014, however since 1977 little additional warming has occurred in Alaska with the exception of Barrow and a few other locations. The stepwise shift appearing in the temperature data in 1976 corresponds to a phase shift of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation from a negative phase to a positive phase. Synoptic conditions with the positive phase tend to consist of increased southerly flow and warm air advection into Alaska during the winter, resulting in positive temperature anomalies.‚Äù one could, if one wanted to be cute with numbers, claim a 9 degree increase over the past 58 years from about 4 below the norm in 1955 to 5 above the norm in 2013. but that isn‚Äôt really how one tracks climate, a long-term phenomenon that operates on the scale of hundreds of years. we do appear to be experiencing a warming trend since the late 1970s. before that, we were experiencing a pretty awful cooling trend. if you were here then (i arrived in ‚Äô73 when half the winter in Fairbanks seemed to be 50 below), you‚Äôd take this over that. and it is interesting to note the regional variations across the state now. the state has been on something of climate plateau since 1977 with annual means for ‚Äô77-2015 increasing slightly in some places but falling in others. the average for that period is 0.3, not 3. how many people were worrying about global warming before ‚Äô77? i wasn‚Äôt. i probably started reporting on it in the late ‚Äô80s or early ‚Äô90s, and our temperatures have been pretty stable since then which is all out of wack with common perception and what one would expect with the global CO2 increase. but maybe we‚Äôre headed for a big spike. the last two years have been awfully warm.
actually, i mean internets. it‚Äôs the jargon of the day online where i met that French model. bon jour!
Sorry for the blog vacation ‚Äì I‚Äôve been working hard on presentations for Startonomics and the Virtual Goods Summit, which has taken a lot of creative juice over the last 2 weeks!
Anyway, I‚Äôm suffering some blogger‚Äôs block right now. I‚Äôd love some suggestions on areas and topics you guys want to hear about. Click here to suggest something, or write me at voodoo [at] gmail. I‚Äôll get back on the horse soon!
I am a Mendocino-based artist working primarily in acrylic paint and mixed media on canvas, and transfer processes on silk. What is hidden has always intrigued me: in the obscured underpainting, in the sylvan understory, in our subconscious. Much of my artmaking entails exploring these hidden realms of looking through layers and into the mystery.
I grew up in a family of makers. Recycled materials, race car parts, seagull bones, vintage kimono sleeves, and silk handkerchiefs have all imprinted on my artmaking since childhood. Some of the more linear forms of that collection find their way into my graphic design business, Tierra.
The vibrant and rugged Mendocino coastline is a constant source of inspiration, both in and out of the water. I‚Äôm a surfer, and there is an inherent correlation between the uncertainty, thrill, and vulnerability of surfing and the creative process for me.

(Vienna, 11 October 2018) Partners from Austria ‚Äì represented by Medical University of Vienna ‚Äì Germany, France and the Netherlands are taking part in the EU "MOON" project (multimodal optical diagnostics for age-related diseases of the eye and central nervous system) to develop new techniques for early diagnosis of these diseases and successfully apply them in treatment and diagnosis. Around 18 months after the start of "MOON", researchers are confident that, in future, it will be possible to use an "eye scan" to diagnose diseases such as Alzheimer's or to detect aggressive forms of age-related macular degeneration at an early stage ‚Äì based on structural and molecular tissue changes on the retina.
"The first concrete results from this project are not expected until the first quarter of 2019 but preliminary investigations are highly promising and suggest that we will be able to obtain high-resolution data about the structure of the retina in future and information about its molecular composition," says Rainer Leitgeb, Project Leader from the Center for Biomedical Physics at the Medical University of Vienna.
To achieve this, the research team are using a combination of several complementary optical techniques, which provide detailed information about the condition of the eye tissue: highly sensitive molecular Raman spectroscopy is combined with optical coherence tomography (OCT). In a matter of seconds, this produces high-resolution images from all layers of the retina ‚Äì including all the information about their molecular composition. Using this data, it will be possible, in future, to make a definitive diagnosis and detect neurodegenerative diseases at an early stage. "The earlier, the better the patient's chances are," emphasises Leitgeb. "It would be wrong to anticipate the results. But one thing is clear: it is possible to take a molecular look into the human eye."
And it is quicker and less invasive than ever before: "Neurodegenerative diseases not only damage the brain but also cause changes in the retina. With our technique, which operates with light, we no longer need to look into the brain. Our goal is for a patient to be able to sit in front of the equipment, have their eye scanned contact-free and be given a reliable diagnosis in only a few minutes," explains the MOON project leader from Vienna.
Experts estimate that the number of people worldwide affected by neurodegenerative diseases will double over the next 30 years, which would be a huge burden for the healthcare system. "However, if we can delay the onset of Alzheimer's by five years, this is not only a huge benefit to sufferers and their families but would also save resources on intensive treatment. Here we are talking about billions of euros. The focus of our research therefore mirrors the strategic direction of Horizon 2020: we are working on the solution to a huge societal challenge."
The European Union is funding the MOON joint project to the tune of around ‚Ç¨3.7 million over a four-year period as part of its Horizon 2020 programme. The project is an initiative of the Public Private Partnership (www.photonics21.org). Project partners are the Medical University of Vienna, Leibniz Institute for Photonic Technologies Jena (Leibniz-IPHT), TNO Optics Expertise Group Delft; Zeiss and HORIBA Scientific, as well as INNOLUME GmbH.
Sentinel-1B satellite is still finalising its commissioning phase, planned to be completed by mid September 2016.
However it was already regularly acquiring data over Italy when the earthquake of magnitude 6.2 occurred on 24 August 2016 over Central Italy.
Six Sentinel-1B Single Look Complex products for the passes just before (20 August 2016, 21 August 2016) and after (27 August 2016, 28 August 2016) the earthquake have been made available for download. These products are not yet fully operationally qualified and are made available as sample products to any Copernicus user in preparation for the operational opening of the S1B products after the satellite commissioning is completed. They allow in particular the 6-day S1A/S1B combined interferometric processing over the earthquake area. The corresponding Sentinel-1A products are nominally available as part of the routine Sentinel-1A operations.
With a bride of Russian heritage and a groom flying in directly from India the day before they wed, this is the ultimate international couple. And what's more, this adorable and oh-so-sweet couple's love truly transcends the test of time and distance. Having met 4 years ago while studying in Italy, they spent most of their relationship long distance with many trips in between. But after a proposal in India last year, and their recent knot-tying, he is finally moving to New York City for good!
And while this intimate marriage ceremony was already packed with so much love and beauty, they have a full wedding ceremony planned for family and friend's this coming September in Italy, with a celebratory reception in India to follow in December.
[NEW GADGET] With such extensive coverage from Engadget live blog to CNA on the telly, do you even need to read somemore facts/opinions/analysis?
Well, yes you do. No, I am kidding. Feel free not to read this. Oops. You just did.
Regardless of the situation, I just say this to satisfy my ego as a blogger. iPhone 4 is out! July looks like the month where iPhone 4 will flood the streets according to the national papers.
From a personal point of view, I think the battery life is going to be a big difference aside from all the features and hardware improvement. An improvement of with seven hours of 3G talk and 10 hours of WiFi data, vs. five hours of talk and nine hours of WiFi data on the 3GS. That could mean that iPhone 4 could last more than 1 day with regular usage. Meaning a couple of hours of surfing and smses.
More significantly, the 3GS is probably on par with high end Android phones in terms of battery life. But now iPhone 4 has raised the bar.

PC SHOW 2010: What to buy?
The state of our waters is a hot button topic. Water quality has become an election issue from Southland to Northland, from towns to nation, and it is often in the news. Swimming water quality and implications of the proposed Ruataniwha water storage and irrigation scheme in Hawke‚Äôs Bay are cases in point.
Sediment plume from Hinemaiaia Stream into Lake Taupo (D. Rowe).
What is at stake varies from place to place, but in general it is our health, wealth and well-being, which include industrial activity and the environment‚Äôs natural character and ecosystem services.
These high stakes are reflected in public surveys. In a 2010 report from Lincoln University, water pollution and other freshwater issues were identified as the most important environmental issues facing New Zealand. While respondents generally thought our waterways were at least in adequate condition, rivers and lakes ranked the worst. And in terms of meeting our ‚Äúclean, green‚Äù image, a 2013 report by Horizon Research found that addressing river and lake water quality topped the to-do list, followed by farm runoff and industrial discharges.
The ‚ÄòDirty Dairying‚Äô campaign mounted by Fish and Game NZ in 2002 no doubt help prime these opinions, while the catch phrase remains in use to this day. But land and freshwater practices are also changing. The campaign was followed a year later by the signing of the voluntary Dairying and Clean Streams Accord between Fonterra, regional councils, and the Ministries for the Environment and of Agriculture and Fisheries, which high-lighted a to-do list for farmers. The 2003 Accord was succeeded by the Sustainable Dairying Water Accord in August 2013, this time a mandatory agreement involving all dairy companies.
Given the nature of the debate, then, it is no surprise that the messages we receive via the media may be as muddied as the rivers or estuaries we‚Äôre trying to protect. Is the Manawatu River one of the dirtiest in the world? Are we ‚Äú100% Pure‚Äù?
The importance of these questions and the complexity of the science behind them led the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment to produce a report in 2012 on the main concerns of water quality ‚Äì pathogens, sediment and nutrients ‚Äì and why they are concerns. It was designed as a guide to the complex science for the public and freshwater professionals alike. But so much of the important science and management frameworks are out of reach from the public, even from many of the freshwater professionals ourselves, either because they don‚Äôt know where to look or don‚Äôt have the background to fully make sense of it.
What would be valuable, and somewhat lacking in New Zealand when it comes to freshwater issues, is a communication middle ground ‚Äì an open forum that fills the gulf between what we hear on the radio and what we hear at a conference. On the one hand this would benefit the public as more and more people engage in collaborative decision-making. On the other hand, freshwater professionals would also benefit as they make their research or policy planning more interdisciplinary.
What is the state of our freshwaters?
And what could or should we do about it?
Articles will range from measurement to management, with two or three articles published each week from October to December. So stay tuned, subscribe, and take part in the discussion.
I am not sure the PCE report explains ‚Äúwhy‚Äù well.
I believe ‚Äòwhy‚Äô requires us to put water quality in context. The PCE does this poorly IMO. eg What was our likely pre-settlement water quality and how do we now compare. The PCE contains plenty of anecdotal evidence but little numerical.
That is a very muddy, grey, unclear, issue.
We have one scientist lined up to talk about the use of models in general, and I‚Äôve specifically requested he mention OVERSEER, but there‚Äôs more to water quality modelling than this model so I didn‚Äôt want to exclude others.
Excited to read the commentary and wider discussion over the coming weeks. I‚Äôd be interested in the experts‚Äô take on the latest changes to the RMA(A) and how changes to notification thresholds might impact on community engagement and goodwill around freshwater management. Grateful we have the longitudinal study of environmental perception so we can track the effects on people‚Äôs perceptions, in light of a changed legislative regime for water infrastructure development.
Hi Robyn. Alas the RMA changes won‚Äôt feature much in this series. They would have been (and were) more fitting in Waiology‚Äôs previous series on water governance, though as the changes were only proposals at the time any discussion was limited. But you raise a good point ‚Äì perhaps next year I can gather a few articles on the implications of the changes for freshwater.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I think Overseer is a great learning/management tool. But as a compliance tool I simply view it as completely unsuitable. With a 30% variability I would challenge any environmental leader to convince me otherwise. The argument ‚Äúit‚Äôs the best we have‚Äù is clearly not acceptable. If you agree with me I would challenge you to make your voice heard. Without it in the near future we could be judging and punishing farmers with a blunt club.
Mike thanks very much for your link.
good to see this forum establishing. Check out the wainz.org.nz website that is an open data collection site that aims to show pics of fresh water pollution from around NZ. Th site together with phone apps and drone surveillance air craft have been developed by the school of science and computer engineering students at Victoria University in conjunction with the Wainz group.
I created diagonal fabric using strings of pinks, on foundation fabric cut 5" x 8" (used those "yucky" thin, cheap fabrics in my stash for foundation). After stringing the foundation, starched, ironed and trimmed to 4.5" x 7.5". Each of the string blocks will be framed by 1.5" strips, finished block 6.5" x 9.5" (including seam allowance).
The setting blocks are 6.5" x 9.5" of pink (yes, more pink). Using 2.5" green squares, stitch diagonally, clip excess, flip and iron.
Now off to make more string blocks.

Based in Santa Ana, CA, Unlimited Capital Group is a private lender offering loans in 15 states across the country. They offer loans for a variety of situations, including fix-and-flip loans, refinancing, bridge loans, loans for rental properties, commercial hard money loans, and new construction loans. They issue loan amounts ranging from $75,000 to $50,000,000 with a maximum LTV of 80% and terms up to 12 months. They make loans on various property types, including single family homes, multi-family units, apartment buildings, office units, retail spaces, hotels and motels, storage facilities, senior facilities, mixed use buildings, warehouses, industrial buildings, medical buildings, undeveloped land, and churches.
Below are the general loan guidelines published on the Unlimited Capital Group website. Please confirm all terms and rates directly with the lender.
The following loans are for education purposes only. They do not represent actual loans executed by Unlimited Capital Group.
Unlimited Capital Group issues a hard money loan to Terrence for a renovation project in Houston, TX, on a property that is listed for $280,000. Because the lender sets a 65% loan-to-value, Terrence will need to put 35% down so the principle amount of the note will be $182,000. The deal also consists of these features: 1) a 18 month term, 2) a 9% interest-only note, and 3) a one percent origination charge.
In accordance with the terms of the note, Terrence will have to pay a $1,820 origination fee in addition to 35% of the sales price, or $98,000, since there is a 65% LTV. After the deal closes, he will pay Unlimited Capital Group $1,365 in monthly interest payments, or 9% multiplied by $182,000 divided by 12 months in a year. If Terrence sells the project for $420,000 after 18 months, he would then realize a total profit of $113,610 after deducting the principle of $182,000, the cash contributed at the close of $98,000, the origination fee of $1,820, and the total interest payments of $24,570. This gross profit does not include renovation costs.

In my previous post - No second helpings, I revealed that I'm starting this new thing. It's not so new really - just new to me. New because, I'm just now doing it for the first time ever.
I did Weight Watchers online a few years ago and I had some success with that but it just didn't hold really. And then, last week on Wednesday I ate a big fat lovely piece of lasagna - three cheese lasagna and it was so fattening and good. And then, I ate a second piece. And then later that night I felt really gassy - to be honest, I did.
Then Thursday came, and I ate leftovers - another half serving of lasagna and then a wicked whipped cream butterscotch dessert. It was very wicked. I felt like eating that was a sin.
Then I started noticing that I eat a lot. I mean I snack all day long. I graze like a cow. I'm constantly in the kitchen every hour or so looking for something to eat. It finally hit me and I could no longer make excuses.
So Friday morning I woke up - and I must have thought about this in bed the night before because I was armed with rules - and then I just did it. I stuck to them.
And here I am going on day 5 of this thing - No second helpings, no snacking between meals - and I do end my lunch and dinner with a sweet thing - it's not a lot compared to before. Usually just a slice of toast with halvarine and honey or vla with a crumbled Speculaas.
Yes, even when we go on vacation to the U.S in a few months I want this down so that I don't end up gaining 10 pounds in two weeks. I think that's how much I gained last time... what with eating ice cream every night, soda pop with my meals, and so on and so on.
Well, I've decided not to give in - anymore... so far I am doing it. Because I believe in it and I believe in me!
Even today, when I was opening up a box of chocolate milk for the little ones, you know, usually I take a sip - just a taste... and I stopped myself from doing that.
Anyway, I got several very nice comments from readers and most of you are "strangers" - because we've never met in person and I was really touched by your enthusiasm. Thanks everyone. It's nice to have a cheering squad.
One comment, in particular, caught my attention. From Sonya. She says she does the same thing, and once a week she bakes. Wow. Once a week. I think I could add that to my rules. I might have to make an exception for birthdays - but I think I could do that.
Actually, once a week seems like a lot but I have many excuses/reasons to bake. Number one reason: FHE.
For those of you not familiar with FHE - this is Mormon lingo for Family Home Evening. This is where we spend one night a week - usually Monday evening as family night. We sing songs, have a lesson about Jesus or something gospel related, play a game, and eat a treat. Okay, not every Mormon family is the same. But most Mormon families eat a treat with FHE. So that's one excuse to bake in the week.
I have other reasons to bake.
Number two... ward calling. You see, I've been very comfortable just coasting along this last half year or so - just you know - taking care of a newborn requires personal attention... but now the Bishop asked that I teach Sunday School to the 14-16 year olds.
I have to admit that I was not prepared for the calling. And also, 14-16 year old boys intimidate me. I don't know why. I think maybe because I'm not around boys very much. And also, when I was 14-16 years old - they intimidated me back then, too.
Luckily, there are some nice girls in the class, too. Girls don't intimidate me - of any age.
I heard from the previous teacher, though, that all you have to do is bring a treat every other week and they love you.
So, I might be able to use that as an excuse as well. You think?
Number three... someone's coming to dinner - bake a nice dessert.
Number four... birthdays... hip hip hooray - or as we say in Dutch hieper de piep hoera!
So, I'm going to add Bake Once A Week to my repertoire - my rules! And we'll see how that goes.
Here is a picture of me from early part of 2010 - just because it's nice to have a photo in every post - even if it doesn't relate to the post.
p.s. I don't normally where that much make up... but I like this picture of me.
LOVE Weight Watcher's! you can eat like a normal person and you don't feel like you are going without.
Good luck to you..loved the picture you posted!
Well, when/if i hit plateau at some future point, then i may go back and do weight watchers, but for now... it's working! yeah!
Wow, you've definitely got a lot on your plate but you seem like a superwoman who can do it all.

Not for profits are being encouraged to nominate themselves for the 2019 Telstra Business Awards.
The team at MS Research won the NSW Telstra 2017 Business Award.
Now in its 27th year, the awards recognise Australia‚Äôs most innovative and entrepreneurial businesses across four categories: emerging and energised, small and succeeding, medium and making waves, and social change maker.
The social change maker category is for organisations that have positive social impact at ‚Äúthe core of their purpose‚Äù.
It is open to not-for-profit, social enterprise and profit-for-purpose organisations ‚Äì contributing a minimum of 10 per cent of their profits back to the cause.
Telstra business awards ambassador and acting group executive of Telstra consumer and small business, Michael Ackland, said business owners and NFPs should take a chance by nominating themselves for this year‚Äôs awards.
He said while 2018 was a record-breaking year for nominations overall, businesses nominating themselves dropped by nearly 20 per cent.
‚ÄúThis tells us that Australia has many incredible small and medium businesses worthy of attention and commendation, but some may need a bit of encouragement to seek the recognition they deserve,‚Äù Ackland said.
‚ÄúA successful business owner is a special breed with unique characteristics. They‚Äôre hungry. They‚Äôre creative. They‚Äôre bold. But at times, they‚Äôre also unsure.
As part of nominating, every entrant will receive a personalised in-depth business report with professional insights and advice to help guide future growth for the business or NFP.
Nominations for the awards are open until 7 March 2019.

My images are developed through an intuitive, playful process as I seek to reflect deep experiences of life's creative flow and brilliance in my work. Putting images down on paper, I spend time listening and responding to the evolving piece. I find the more open and curious I become, the more harmonic and unexpected the expression becomes. This expression comes from a profound and very alive place I feel is available to us all.
The feel, composition and meaning for each piece are built up through a layering of collage materials, mono printing and mark making. Collage papers are hand-painted, found, digital, mono-printed or stenciled. Some are very translucent and others opaque. Mono prints are printed directly on the base paper or on various kinds of papers applied later as collage. Marks and gestures are made with pencil, pen, marker, charcoal, pastel or paint directly onto the collage surface or onto the collage papers. Many times cut or ripped components from earlier pieces are brought in.
There is for me a love of the written word in the sense of the flow and visual language as in a poem rather than the details of a narrative. You‚Äôll see that rarely can the words written be understood but instead there is something about how language and image meet in a new expressive form.
I have also been bringing in natural, almost recognizable elements; a reflection of the natural world. These may be a whale‚Äôs fin; the sensual movement of a serpent‚Äôs form; the movement of the sea, teeming with life. This speaks to me of the wonder of creation, the power of life running through all our cells.

Freemasonry involves a number of fraternal societies. These organisations have their origins in the stonemasons which were important members of political and social life during the fifteenth century. Members can attain degrees of freemasonry at three distinct grades. These are apprentice, journeyman and master mason.
Each graded candidate is taught the mysterious symbols of the society and their various meanings. As they progress up the ranks their knowledge of the order also grows. This can take decades to complete. Initiations are important to the masons. They are a mixture of allegory and lecture.
The Blue Lodge or Craft are the main bodies that offer freemasonry degrees. Candidates can also attain additional ones which will depend on their location. Usually secondary degrees are awarded by separate mason organisations.
The base of operations for mason bodies are known as lodges. Each small lodge is usually supervised by a larger body called a grand lodge. These are regional rather than national bodies. In fact there is no worldwide superior lodge. Each one is independent and will not always recognise the legitimacy of other lodges. This makes the structure of freemasonry as a whole complicated and at times chaotic.
Modern day freemasonry has been split into two unique subsets. The first is regular freemasonry. Followers of this type state their belief in what they call a ‚ÄúSupreme Being‚Äù. Desp ite this they are forbidden from discussing religion while in the lodge. Additionally, politics is a taboo subject of discussion.
The second form is continental freemasonry. These are jurisdictions that have scrapped some of the more archaic rules. Free speech is encouraged and life within the lodge is more progressive.
Members meet at lodges on a regular basis in order to conduct their business. This includes organising charity events and electing new candidates. Sometimes they also perform different ceremonies and give lectures. Remembering the rich history of freemasonry is important for these organisations and so they use lectures to reflect on the past.
After these meetings have been concluded it is common for a formal dinner to take place. Toasts and singing can form a part of these meals. However, most of their rituals are focused on degree ceremonies.
They have unique ceremonies for each grading stage. During these the candidate is given secret passwords and handshakes which they are entrusted to keep out of public knowledge. There are different handshakes for each grade. There is also a special ceremony for installing the lodge‚Äôs officers and master. This is done on an annual basis.
Social gatherings are very important to masons. Their calendars keep them busy with regular meetings and formal engagements. Not all of these are ritualised. A fair amount of them are set in more relaxed environments. Philanthropy is a key aspect of freemasonry. Members strive to fund education programmes, disaster relief and different charities.

Overseas property can appear to be an attractive investment when it is being sold to you. This particularly applies if the property is in an exotic location and comes with the promise of high returns. After all, the returns in traditional ‚Äì and safer ‚Äì investments have been conservative over recent years.
It is not surprising, therefore, that many people invested in Salina Seas and similar overseas property opportunities. This includes people who invested all or part of their pension in a SIPP investment.
For various reasons, some of the people who invested in Salina Seas were mis-sold. If you suspect this applies in your case, you should get in touch with us.
Complete the form on this page to give us your contact number. We will then get an advisor with knowledge of Salina Seas to call you back. They will get an understanding of your circumstances and the nature of your investment before helping you make a claim.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) does not usually regulate overseas property investments. Salina Seas is a development on an island off the coast of Africa, so it falls into this category.
The fact the investment is not regulated or covered by the FCA compensation scheme immediately makes it a higher risk investment than standard opportunities.
To find out how we can help you recover money lost in a Salina Seas investment, please call us today on 0808 252 3696.

You see, your nervous system controls EVERYTHING in your body. Every cell, tissue and organ in your body is controlled by your nervous system (Brain and Spinal Cord). When there is interference in that system (Spinal Subluxation) your body may not work properly. If that interference is left in the body over time, you may or start to experience pain. Unfortunately, many people wait until they have pain before they see a chiropractor. Although it is effective at that point, it will require extra work to get rid of the pain and move towards greater health. Prevention is key!
This project is not maintained anymore, it is kept alive just to historical/educational reasons.
libevent is a popular API that provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due to signals or regular timeouts.
eventxx is a simple, direct, one-header inline C++ wrapper for libevent. Yes, it's just one header file, so if you want to use it you can just copy the file to your project and you are set (well, you'll need to link to libevent too ;).
It's designed to be as close to use to libevent (without compromising modern C++ programming techniques) and efficient (since all implementation is trivial and inline, theoretically, it imposes no overhead at all) as possible.
Please, visit the eventxx website for the latest version of this documentation.
You can always get the current release from the release directory or grab the most up to date sources from the git repository.
You can also take a look the the eventxx gitweb interface to see the latest changes online or subscribe to its Atom feed to follow the development.
You probably should read libevent documentation to get started or at least just for reference, although eventxx is pretty simple so you can jump right into the Example section (or the example list) and write a working program without much trouble.
This wrapper was designed to be used just like libevent, but with C++ style syntax sugar (or poison, depends on your point of view ;) and goodies. The main difference to libevent is you always have to instance a eventxx::dispatcher to get an event loop. There is no implicit global event loop. This adds just an extra line of code for single threaded applications and makes things much more simpler, so I hope nobody complains about it ;). See eventxx::dispatcher documentation for more details.
You can use use the same plain functions callbacks libevent use or the other kind of function objects (see Events section for details on event types).
eventxx uses Exceptions to report errors. All functions have exception specifications, so it's easy to find out what to expect. See Exceptions section for more detail.
A timespec abstraction is provided as eventxx::time for convenient argument passing. Even more, it's a timespec itself, with some convenient methods for accessing the attributes with pritier names. And even more, eventxx is such a direct mapping that all eventxx::event's are libevent event structs too, so theoretically you can pass a eventxx::event to libevent C functions without much trouble. eventxx::dispatcher is the only class that is not derived from libevent struct (event_base) because this struct it's not defined on the libevent header (just declared).
Maybe you shouldn't know this implementation details to keep the abstraction, but this is a basic design goal of this wrapper so there is not much chance that this changes in the future (but use this knowledge with care, you have been warned ;).
You can see more examples on the test directory of the distribution or on the examples related page.
I think the library is stable now. The library has no support for buffered events yet, but patches are welcome. It doesn't support the HTTP stuff, and probably never will because that has nothing to do with event handling.
libevent had a memory leak before version 1.3b (before 1.2 it didn't even had a way free that memory, from version 1.2 to 1.3a, if you tried to free the memory the program abort() because a failed assertion). Because of that, there is a way to disable the dispatcher destructor (which calls the inexistent/broken event_base_free() function in the broken versions). So if you use a libevent version previous to 1.3b, you have to compile your programs defining the EVENTXX_NO_EVENT_BASE_FREE macro.
If something is broken it would be really easy to fix because eventxx is just a simple wrapper around libevent. So, please try it out, and if you have any problems, drop me an e-mail and and I'll fix it ASAP (or provide a patch and you will be my best friend ;).
If you use this library, please drop me an e-mail with your thoughts, or simply saying "I use it", so I can keep track of how many people really use it.

Before reading this post i reqest you to read my previous post ‚ÄúUbuntu Dapper Drake is easier to install than windows xp‚Äù.
Next, you will be asked about your full name , username, password and computer name.
You can see the partitions of my Hard Disk 1 (80 GB one) . I want to install Ubuntu at the last partition ( as you can see the below screenshot the last box ‚Äì blue one ). So, i deleted the last partition ( you can delete a partition by right clicking on the partition & select delete ). I have 10 GB left (Free Space).
Lets say you have 10 GB of free space, you should create 2 partitions , one for swap partition & second for ext3 partition.
Click New button , and give the size for the swap partition ( If you have 128 MB RAM give 250 MB , for 256 MB give 500 MB, for 512 MB give 900 MB ) . Select Filesystem as linux-swap. Click Add.
Click New button, leave New Size as Maximum size ( I have 8.88 GB (9101 MB) remaining free space, so i allocated it for ext3 ), select create as Logical Partition, Filesystem as ext3 (as shown below), Click Add button.
You will be asked to specify mount points, just leave it (default) , click forward.
And i suggest you to discuss about the facilities for those who are very much intrested in using ubuntu and fortunately not having an internet connection ‚Ä¶.
Hey Abhinay, it would be very nice if you would keep a section on how to use the installation/live cd to fix a corrupted grub loader. Because even if someone installed this, if they later install windows, their grub loader might be corrupted and they might not have any idea what happened to their ubuntu OS.

Prostitution may be one of the oldest trades to exist, but it‚Äôs still quite illegal in Texas and throughout the United States. Many people have wondered, ‚ÄúWhy is prostitution against the law?‚Äù There are a couple main reasons why it‚Äôs illegal. For one, to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Second, to reduce the demand for underage prostitutes, many of whom are victims of human trafficking.
In public, solicit another person to engage in sexual conduct with the prostitute.
Please be aware that you can commit the offense of prostitution, even if the act is not carried out or completed. Simply offering or agreeing to engage in prostitution is enough to be arrested and charged with this offense.
Prostitution under Sec. 43.02 is a Class B misdemeanor for a first offense, punishable by a fine not to exceed $2,000, or by up to 180 days in jail, or by a fine and imprisonment. Prostitution is a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a $4,000 fine, or by up to a year in jail, or by a fine and imprisonment.
Prostitution is a state jail felony when the individual has been previously convicted of the offense on three or more occasions, and it is a felony of the second degree when the person solicited was under the age of 18. Please note that not knowing the minor‚Äôs age is not considered a valid defense.

A young quickie from Jamaica who can bowl out-and-out fast, Jerome Taylor is a great future bowling prospect for West Indies.
Taylor was just 18 years old, with a lone one-day match for Jamaica under his belt, when he was called into the West Indies squad for the final match of their series against Sri Lanka in June 2003. Later, as India toured the Caribbean in mid-2006, a quick and accurate Taylor troubled the Indian batsmen, and thrilled his home crowd with notable performances. He established himself in the 2006 DLF Cup in Malaysia, and backed his performance with a hat-trick to lead his nation to an impressive victory over Australia in the Champions Trophy. In 2008, he emerged as the leading wicket-taker for the West Indies in the Test series against the Lankans. Apart from his fiery bowling, Taylor is also a handy lower order batsman and surprised spectators with a Test century, batting at No.8 against the Black Caps.
With the potential to rip through any batting order, young Taylor holds the responsibility to spearhead a young Windies pace attack in the new generation.
The Question Is‚Ä¶ - How Will You Be Remembered?
When I was writing the first draft of this article, I searched for a title. I needed something catchy and cute. Since I was unable to come up with something, I pondered and pondered. Then it hit me. Edit Johnny Carson‚Äôs shtick.
The question that I had burned into my frontal lobe of my brain is what will be my legacy? That haunting question is tied to Randy Pausch and Bobby Kennedy. However, this essay is about something more personal. It is related to something that Ti Ti told me when she and her two younger sisters were on a shopping spree.The first part of our picking out clothes and toys went extremely well. Snow and Fatty both picked out cute tops and dolls.
When it was Ti Ti‚Äôs turn, she said she didn‚Äôt need anything. Nonetheless, that was in juxtaposition to my need to express my love to her. I merely wanted her to pick out a couple of items. In desperation, Ti Ti said that she wanted me to pick out a gift for her. In that way, it would remind her of me when I returned to the States. While I heard her plea and at one level understood it, I continued to suggest that she should pick out something. I wanted something that she liked. I didn‚Äôt want to be remembered for picking out something that she didn‚Äôt like.
Having said that, it wasn‚Äôt until after she bought a cute dress that I finally got her comment. I realized that I should have listened better. I quickly returned to a store and got her a scarf.
However, remembering is a two-way street. I too will remember Ti Ti for many things that I love about her. She is brilliantly intelligent, she is a very driven person, she is caring, and she is fun to be with.
As for Snow, I‚Äôll remember that she is like Ti Ti but just several years younger. She is the most focused person that I have ever met though. We were at a restaurant, and she was watching a program on TV while waiting for the meal to be served. I waved my hand in front of her face several times. She did not even notice my hand.
However, the far more important thing that I will always remember has to do with holding hands with her. When we were walking someplace, she started holding my hand. She didn‚Äôt mention it; she just took a hold of my hand and continued to walk‚Ä¶hand in hand.
When going out for dinner on the last day that I would be with the family, I was sitting between Snow and Fatty in the back seat of their family‚Äôs car. I took hold of her hand without saying anything during the drive to the restaurant and then to my hotel.
I will remember Ko Ko, who is the girls‚Äô father. He is caring and loving just like everyone in the family, but he is a mechanical genius. He designed their home and wired it. Ko Ko and Moh Moh gave me a framed picture of Inle Lake as a gift. In a matter of a couple days he built a protective carrier for their picture. It was made so well that my picture arrived at home without any damage or even a scratch.
The other thing is that Ko Ko‚Äôs mind is like a computer. Much of the time while around Inle Lake, he was my guide, except for the day that Moh Moh and Ti Ti were my guides. Ko Ko knows all the sites to show tourists, but he would ask me what I really wanted to see. Any data that I would give him was entered into his computer. It was processed, scheduled, and carried out. Anything that I would mention during the day, it would be like cutting and pasting to a Word document. I was truly amazed to see the efficiency of his mental ability, which I nicknamed his computer.
Moh Moh is so much like Bobby that I wrote a note about the parallels between the two of them on the title page of Bobby Kennedy, which was one of my gifts for her. She is soft-spoken and caring. She wants to help in any way she can. She is there to assist.
It is amazing to me the level of love and caring that my family in Myanmar possess. As long as I am around, I‚Äôll never forget them. I‚Äôm sure that they won‚Äôt forget me either. However, my family overseas is an important lesson for all my readers. It should raise the question in your minds about how you will be remembered when you are no longer around. At 75, I don‚Äôt know how many years I have remaining, but my recent trip to Myanmar won‚Äôt be my last. I need to visit my family again.
Soy milk vs. cow's milk: Which is better?
Most adults get their exercise through deliberate activities such as running or walking, riding a stationary bike, or taking an aerobics class. They do this for the sake of reaching or maintaining a preferred weight and taking advantage of the many physical and psychological benefits of exercise. While children stand to benefit from exercise in the same ways adults do, their reasons for exercising are completely different. Whether they are participating in a team sport, playing games at recess, or riding bikes with friends in the neighborhood, children often only get exercise simply by doing something they find fun.
Unfortunately, many children today consider sedentary activities such as watching television and playing video games more fun than games that involve physical activity. In the face of a growing epidemic of childhood obesity, we must rethink our priorities and put our health and the health of our children first. Children who lead active lives will likely have leaner bodies, stronger bones and muscles, improved coordination, better posture, and fewer health complications as adults. In addition to the physical benefits, active children concentrate better in school, have increased self-esteem, are less likely to suffer from depression or anxiety, and have a better overall outlook on life.
To increase your child's activity level, you must first disengage them from activities that promote idleness and then re-engage them with safe, fun, active alternatives. Like any lifestyle change, this takes determination and dedication. Following are some tips that will help you make the shift.
Most children spend at least four to six hours per day on these sedentary activities. This should be reduced to no more than one to two hours per day. You will likely face resistance to this change. To make the transition easier, make televisions, computers, and video games less of a focal point. For example, try removing them from bedrooms, limiting the household to one television, and designating one family media area. If you don't trust yourself to enforce the rules you've made, eliminate the problem. Video games, computer games, and even televisions are not necessities in a child's life.
Also see the following article on TheDietChannel: Does TV Make Kids Fat?
Children imitate adult behavior. Children with active parents are usually active themselves. Children whose parents watch excessive amounts of television are likely to do the same.
Play tag or hide and seek, kick a soccer ball, or take a walk around the neighborhood. Playing together is not only an opportunity to exercise, it is also bonding time.
Find out what physical activities your child finds fun and make those activities a priority.
Increase your child's self-confidence and satisfaction with exercise by encouraging him and offering personal compliments. Telling children they are doing a good job is one of the best ways to keep them doing a good job. Be careful not to use sedentary activities such as computer time as a reward.
Children come in all shapes and sizes. Resist pressures to change or control your child's weight. Teach him that physical activity will keep him healthy and strong at any size. If you accept your child as he is, he will be more likely to accept and feel good about himself.
How much activity/exercise is enough?
According to the 2005 dietary guidelines from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), all children two years and older should get at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise on most, preferably all, days of the week. It is important to note that not all of the physical activity has to be completed at one time to reap the benefits.
You will likely face strong resistance to some of these changes. Remember that they are in the best interest of your child. Whether or not your child likes you for it, it is your role as a parent to set limits. Whatever you do, do not give in to the pleading, or your child will resist with more force each time.
Start today by brainstorming with your child to find a variety of activities that are a good fit for his personality, ability, age and interests. Then give your child as many opportunities as possible to be active.
Malaika Arora and Arjun Kapoor are grabbing headlines for their rumoured relationship. Now if reports are to be believed, Malaika and Arjun might marry each other this year.
Previously, Malaika was Salman Khan‚Äôs sister-in-law. She was married to his brother, Arbaaz Khan, while Arjun had dated his sister, Arpita Khan Sharma.
According to latest reports, Salman has banned Arjun and Boney Kapoor from entering his house due to Arjun's growing closeness with Malaika.
Kangana Ranaut, who is geared up for her upcoming film Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi, is interested to work with Priyanka Chopra. Recently, while talking to media, she said that she would like to do a supergirls movie with PeeCee. "I would definitely like to do a movie with Priyanka,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúMe and Priyanka can kick some butts and that movie can be a blasting one,‚Äù added Kangana.
After her wedding, Priyanka Chopra has been setting all kinds of goals - couple goals, fashion goals, career goals and so much more.
She is currently on her honeymoon with husband Nick Jonas and they look madly in love and their pictures make us feel awwww!
Over the past few months, the Me Too campaign has exploded in Bollywood, thanks to Tanushree Dutta for renewing a decade-old sexual harassment case against Nana Patekar due to which several actresses have come out in open, calling out their sexual predators.
While a lot of B-town actors and actresses have extended their solidarity towards all the women who have shared their Me Too stories, in a recent interview, when Black actress Rani Mukerji was asked about her stance on #MeToo, she had a slightly different take on the whole movement and she had said that a woman needs to take responsibility for herself.
THIS makes Nargis Fakhri heated!
For a while now I have been struggling with just what to do with this blog space. In the past I've thought it should look like tons of other blogs out there. You know, to be a successful blogger your blog should have... You should write about... and so on. But all of that advice is geared towards a goal of growing a blog and making it profitable.
Carolyn Mahaney and her daughters recently wrote a series of blog posts about the internet, social media, and their impact (good and bad) on us as mothers and homemakers. It reminded me that there's no reason for me to do anything with this blog that I'm not passionate about because ultimately I write for me. It also reminded me of how discouraging it can be to see everyone else's lives only when they are all put together and to hear so many voices.
"Teach your children this way."
"Feed you family this food."
"Make your home look this way."
"How-to" posts, and things of that nature aren't all bad. They can be helpful, and I do want to share some of what works for our family. I don't ever want to be one of those voices that says, "To be a good mom, you have to do things exactly as I do." I want to be the one saying, "It's hard to follow Christ, and to overflow with His grace toward our families, and to get dinner on the table."
And that's why I need Christ and His grace. That's why I need to keep a proper perspective. Keep first things first, and then let the others come as they will. Don't be self-defeating. That's what I want this place to be. A place where you can see that life is messy, and houses are messy, and disasters happen, and IT IS OK.
Forum goer Zaphys will be hosting a screening of King of the Planet 11 at Edinburgh University in Scotland for the local gaming society as part of a drive to increase interesting in Planetary Annihilation in the area. An opportunity to watch King of the Planet on the big screen? Sounds awesome. Zaphys has also done a ‚ÄúPA Intro Session‚Äù and is planning to introduce Planetary Annihilation as part of their 24hr LAN event.
If you‚Äôre interested in attending then drop him a private message on the Uber forums.
We expect to see videos or pictures of these events, Zaphys!
Did you miss King of the Planet #9? It was short, but intense. Catch-up on all the action now by checking out the VODs we‚Äôve uploaded in the matches section. Witness the drama and see whether Matiz held his crown or Elodea finally proved his match.
Both Matiz and elodea had been practicing all week for it, then on Saturday night Uber dropped a bombshell: a new patch with a new meta.
People thought the changes to Dox would lead to them dominating the game, and initial impressions appear to be that this is true. Certainly it was a war of Dox, with Dox raids, Dox defence and Dox aggression. Orbital also managed to play a key part of the final outcome for the first time in King of the Planet history.
But where the variety lacked in the unit selection it was more than made up for in the maps. We had multi-planet, we had moons, we had water, we even got the rarely seen metal biome.
In the end it was elodea‚Äôs greater experience with Dox which won out and caused a 3-0 landslide in under an hour. Matiz was better prepared than he was for King of the Planet #8, but it was for a meta which no longer existed. He describes his experience as King of the Planet and his hopes for the future of Planetary Annihilation in this final interview.
VODs will be uploaded over the course of the week.
In week 8 of this series, the lord emperor PAG_Matiz battled with his brother-in-arms PAG_Clopse. We saw a world where air was in a greater use than ever before.
The meta favoured Clopse and it was obvious that Matiz was not well prepared, even losing on Tanis the world he was considered unbeatable on. But showing why he was king he managed to come back from 2-1 down to win 3-2, concluding with a decisive victory in the fifth game and a little of the Matiz sass we know and love.
In week 9 of this series eXodus eSports will be streaming a best-of-five between King of the Planet PAG_Matiz and the challenger, PAG_elodea, at 17:00 UTC on Sunday, 10th August.
King of the Planet #8 announced!
In week 7 of this series his highness PAG_Matiz fought Uber‚Äôs bradnicholson. Orbital was the theme, and the king was clearly confused on multiple occasions to the delight of all.
The event will be hard to top, culminating in PAG_Matiz dropping a planet on himself by mistake, followed by the Steam daily deal on Planetary Annihilation being so successful we couldn‚Äôt continue the event. The king ended up triumphing 2-0. Or 2.5-0.5 as Brad likes to say.
In week 8 of this series eXodus eSports will be streaming a best-of-five between King of the Planet PAG_Matiz and the challenger, PAG_Clopse, at 18:00 UTC on Sunday, 6th July.
Confidence abounds, with both sure that they can destroy the other. With the biome rules introduced in King of the Planet 7 they can each only pick a moon once, so they finally both need to discover that the game has other biomes. Will Matiz‚Äôs experience in King of the Planet biome variety tell? Will Clopse use Matiz‚Äôs poor knowledge of orbital against him? Will America celebrating the victory of the French over the British mean they battle alone?
Tune in to King of the Planet #8 to find out!
It was the first multi-planet King of the Planet. It was the first King of the Planet to have three casters. I think everyone could agree it was probably the most amusing King of the Planet yet. King PAG_Matiz and Uber‚Äôs Community Manager bradnicholson, the self-declared best player the game has ever seen, squared off for the crown, but neither could defeat the might of the Steam daily deal which brought the event to a premature close when Ubernet could no longer cope with the demand and failed to spawn additional lobbies.
PAG_Matiz managed to hold onto his crown in a 2-0 victory, with the third game resulting in our first ever draw as the king teleported his commander onto the planet which he was smashing a moon into. A fabulous way to bring the event to a close.
We were very happy with the way multi-planetary systems panned out and the confusion it brought for at least one of our players. It hasn‚Äôt been a big element of 1v1 play, but hopefully that will begin to change. Expect to see it return.
Another challenger is already lined up, so expect an announcement soon and join us for more exciting King of the Planet!
In week six of this series our lord and master, king PAG_Matiz fought [BL] Murcanic. Surprises abound, including the first comm boxing map seen, but showing why he wears the crown PAG_Matiz was able to keep his throne with a close fought 3-2 victory.
In week 7 of this series eXodus eSports will be streaming a best-of-five between King of the Planet PAG_Matiz and the challenger, Uber‚Äôs Brad Nicholson, at 18:00 UTC on Sunday, 22nd June.
Brad had this to say, ‚ÄúWELCOME TO BRAD NICHOLSON‚ÄôS FREAK SHOW MATIZ. I‚ÄôM GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME.‚Äù A true people‚Äôs poet.
This will be the first King of the Planet to allow for multi-planet systems. Will we see a YOLO?
Will Brad do Uber proud, or will Matiz sleepwalk his way to a 3-0 victory? It‚Äôs a new patch, a new balance and a new meta. Will it be nothing but tank spam? Will air be as OP as some claim? Make sure to tune in to exodusesports.com at the appointed hour to find out!
It was epic and it was grueling, but in week 5 of this series our protector king PAG_Matiz defeated the upstart [RLM] burntcustard 3-2, the first time this event has gone to game 5!
In week 6 of this series, ZaphodX and thesambasti will be streaming a best-of-five between King of the Planet PAG_Matiz and the challenger [BL] Murcanic at 18:00 UTC on Sunday, 1st June.
PAG_Matiz is definitely the favourite for this, but the two have never previously met in battle so perhaps [BL] Murcanic will be able to bamboozle our king. PAG_Matiz demonstrated the effectiveness of Grenadiers and Infernos, but the patch was fresh; will we see something better from either player this time? What weird and wonderful planets will we see the players trip one another up with? Will PAG_Matiz finally choose something that isn‚Äôt a moon?
Make sure to tune in to exodusesports.com at the appointed hour to find out! Ensure you don‚Äôt miss out by subscribing to one (or more!) of our channels.
‚Ä¶ who‚Äôs the same as the old King of the Planet!!! PAG_Matiz holds his position as king with a 3-2 victory over the challenger, [RLM] burntcustard.
We want to thank everyone who showed up to watch and cheer for their favorite player. It was a set of close, intense games, and we even managed to break our viewership records with 350+ unique viewers. You can find all sorts of info, including individual matches and results, at the event‚Äôs official page. You can also discuss the event on the Uberent forums here.
Congratulations once again to PAG_Matiz. THE KING LIVES, LONG LIVE THE KING!!
Tune in this Sunday, May 18th, at 18:00 for another epic KoTP matchup. This time, our king, PAG_matiz, will face off against the winner of PACE‚Äôs Master of May competition, [RLM]burntcustard. All details can be found on the tournament page!

We will meet between 11 and 11:30 at the Pooley Bridge pier. From there we can assess the weather and make sure everyone has arrived in time for a 12:10 steamer departure for Howtown. We will arrive to Howtown shortly after 12:30. There are two options for the walk back to Pooley Bridge. The longer, more scenic route is 6 miles and classified as moderate to easy. The other option is a bit shorter and even easier, hugging the lake more and missing some of the higher ground with its better vistas. The longer route takes about 3 hours to complete, bringing us back to cars ahead of dusk and in time to go share a cuppa at a local cafe.
If we arrive and decide the open lake is too much to brave for weather reasons, there is a 3 mile walk at the Glenridding end of the lake that takes us to Seldom Seen, through Glencoyne Wood, which looks to be an easy, sheltered, woodsy walk. And with Glenridding near at hand we are never far from shelter and warm drinks.
Hope to see everyone there this Sunday! We will have a lovely adventure no matter what the weather!

During an April 24 meeting of the Robstown Area Development Corporation, it was revealed that the organization has not conducted required yearly audits for the past four years, has not filed required information to the Internal Revenue Service during that same time period and has not kept accurate records on payroll and purchase order expenditures.
Since our first story on this issue ran on April 30, more than one person has asked why this issue has earned so much attention. I have a few answers.
Every reader should care about this issue because the money that the RADC receives does not just magically appear in its bank account every year. It's taken from you, in the form of taxes.
When taxpayers have money taken from them, there is an understanding between the taxing entity and the taxpayer that the money will be handled in a responsible manner and be used for worthwhile reasons.
In fact, this responsibility is so great that a series of checks and balances are put into place to ensure that the money is not misused. In this case, many of those checks and balances failed.
Most of the blame for the RADC's financial problems has been placed at the feet of Ken Faughn, the organization's executive director. In many instances, this blame is placed correctly, and Faughn has acknowledged that it was his responsibility to file tax information and obtain annual audits. Filing tax forms, conducting annual audits and keeping track of expenditures is really the bare minimum of responsibilities needed to keep a non-profit organization afloat, so it is troubling that these actions were not conducted correctly.
However, it would be shortsighted to place all of the blame on Faughn, since those checks and balances do exist. While Faughn is the executive director of the organization, he answers to a 17-member board.
This board is made up of many elected officials, bankers, lawyers and business professionals. It is difficult to understand how a board of individuals from those different walks of life was unable to foresee a potential problem like the one that has arisen here. The board members have a responsibility to ensure that their employees are conducting the organization's business in a proper manner, and his failure is their failure.
But the checks and balances did not end with the board. The RADC receives funding from a number of taxing entities, including Nueces County, the City of Robstown and the Port of Corpus Christi. Each of these entities has, as part of their agreement with the organization, a requirement that the RADC present regular financial reports, in some cases as frequently as once a quarter, to their governing bodies.
In every instance, though, those taxing entities failed to do their part in holding the RADC financially accountable. For four years, Nueces County Commissioners, Robstown City Council members and Port of Corpus Christi Commission members were negligent in their responsibility to require these regular reports. While I have sat through many a tedious meeting listening to financial reports from organizations, the recent problems at the RADC demonstrate why those "boring" reports are so necessary.
Granted, the City of Robstown finally held the RADC accountable for its failure to present financial reports by limiting their funding this year, but I don't give very many points for that action.
For one, the decision to withhold funding has come after four years of negligence- too long, in my opinion. And second, the mayor and mayor pro-tem of the city are part of the 17-member board that oversees the RADC.
Although both Rodrigo Ramon Jr. and Elias Vasquez have said their calls for financial reports from within the RADC went unheeded, the fact that other board members say they were unaware of the problems makes one wonder how loudly they were calling. The strange act of sanctioning the RADC from their city council seats while sitting on the RADC board is difficult to understand.
With all this said, what happens now? There should be a renewed sense of responsibility regarding this issue at every level. Obviously, the issue of the executive director's missteps needs to be addressed, and taxpayers should have assurances that the RADC has responsible leadership.
Second, board members who were unaware of these issues need to look within to determine why they were oblivious. Perhaps some of those members should be asking a few more questions. On another level, the elected officials who give taxpayer money to organizations like the RADC need to look a little closer when they write those checks, and ask a few more questions of their own.
And, most importantly, the taxpayers need to understand that they don't just hand their money over into the dark. They have a right to require that their money be handled properly.

nytimes.com ‚Äì What with everything else going on, from Trump to Brexit to the horror in Dallas, it‚Äôs hard to focus on developments in financial markets ‚Äî especially because we‚Äôre not facing any immediate crisis. But extraordinary things have been happening lately, especially in bond markets. And because money still makes the world go ‚Äôround, attention must be paid to what the markets are trying to tell us.
In the crowded and versatile class of compact SUVs, the 2018 Nissan Rogue is a standout option that offers upscale style, a spacious cargo area, and some of the best modern technology and safety features on the market today.
Drivers in Philadelphia, Lansdale, and Doylestown can discover all the 2018 Rogue has to offer with our in-depth review.
The new Nissan Rogue seats five people in its two rows. Its standard upholstery is high-quality cloth, though leather upholstery, heated seating, and power-adjustable seating are available upgrades. There‚Äôs plenty of head- and legroom in all seating positions, as well as heavily-bolstered, supportive seats, though its second-row space is truly impressive.
The 2018 Nissan crossover also offers some of the most cargo capacity in the class. There‚Äôs 39.3 ft3 behind the rear seat, which opens to an expansive 70 ft3 when they‚Äôre folded flat. The Rogue is also equipped with the Divide-N-Hide¬Æ cargo system, which features two maneuverable platforms that allow you to stow your cargo away or create shelving.
The Rogue‚Äôs interior is also decked out with the latest technology, including the intuitive NissanConnect¬Æ touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay‚Ñ¢ and Android Auto‚Ñ¢ smartphone integration, which is standard for all models. Bluetooth¬Æ connectivity, a Bose¬Æ sound system, HD Radio‚Ñ¢, satellite radio, and navigation are some other great features.
Take a look at the 2018 Nissan Rogue and 2018 Honda CR-V and compare their best features so you can pick a dependable, affordable crossover.
Aside from its excellent performance on federal and independent safety tests, the 2018 Nissan Rogue includes many safety features as standard equipment for all its models. Blind-spot monitoring, Forward Collision Warning, a rearview camera, Rear Cross-Traffic Alert, and automatic emergency braking are all included at the base level. Optional safety features include the ProPILOT Assist system, which is an advanced safety feature that can steer, brake, and accelerate the vehicle autonomously. Adaptive Cruise Control, pedestrian detection, a surround-view camera, and Lane Keeping Assist are also available options.
The 2018 Nissan Rogue is equipped with a powerful 2.5L four-cylinder that‚Äôs well suited to the ins and outs of urban traffic, though it offers more than enough acceleration for passing on a busy highway. It comes with a smooth-shifting Continuously Variable Transmission and front-wheel drive standard, though all-wheel drive is an available option.
The Rogue is balanced like a much smaller vehicle, so it‚Äôs capable of taking on tight turns with precision and poise. Its steering is also well-weighted and excellent at maintaining an on-center feel, even at highway speeds, but it‚Äôs still light enough for tight maneuvering in confined areas. There‚Äôs no body roll when cornering, and the well-tuned suspension glides over any road imperfections with ease.
With sporty performance, outstanding standard safety features, an upscale, comfortable interior and one of the most spacious cargo bays in its class, the 2018 Nissan Rogue is a great choice among compact crossovers.
Drivers in Philadelphia, Lansdale, and Doylestown can experience the 2018 Nissan Rogue for themselves by visiting Montgomeryville Nissan. Stop by today to schedule your test drive!

The Industry Advisory Board for this course is made up of representatives from several organisations who have an interest in safety and accident investigation. The board meets annually to ensure the course content remains relevant and up-to-date.
The programme commences with attendance on the Aircraft Accident Investigation module, which may be completed as two three-week modules in Fundamentals of Investigation and Applied Aircraft Accident Investigation.
Upon completion of these core modules, you can then select four optional modules (covering core investigation skills, management, engineering, human factors and specialist techniques). Most optional modules are one week and many are offered as standalone short courses.
The majority of your third year is devoted to completing the individual research project, where each student will be supervised individually by a member of an academic staff.
The individual research project is a chance to study a specific subject or problem area in much greater depth and use some of the techniques learned during the course. It gives MSc students an opportunity to apply the technical and analytical skills taught during the course, in a practical way. The subject areas chosen for research projects will be ones which require the student to review literature, collect data, carry out scientific analysis and contribute to either body of knowledge or practical application. The output of this project is a written report presented in the format of a journal paper.
This module builds on the Fundamentals of Accident Investigation to develop specialist skills for the investigation of aircraft accidents.
1.	Work safely without supervision at an accident site.
2.	Describe common failure types and their symptoms in terms of structures, powerplants and propulsion, aircraft systems and human factors.
3.	Describe and contrast the differences between the investigation of civil and military; less complex and more complex aircraft, and between fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft accidents.

The Investigating Human Performance Module encourages students to look critically at the contribution humans make in High reliability Organisations (HRO‚Äôs). Using psychological theory and analysis, the human contribution (positive and sometimes negative) is addressed. Theories and approaches of human performance explored on this module, help the investigator understand the human factors not only affecting those involved with accidents or incidents, but also the factors affecting the investigator.
4.	Identify at what point an expert should be approached about the collection or analysis of human performance evidence.
Crisis management is a topic area relevant to airlines, airports and other organisations involved with delivering air transport. These organisations typically have dedicated personnel and departments to emergency response and crisis planning.

The Interviewing for Accident Investigators module is designed to provide delegates with an enhanced level of theoretical and practical skills to effectively interview various types of witness to gather evidence in support of successful safety accident investigations.
The module adopts a balanced curriculum of theoretical learning and practical sessions involving interviews of live witnesses, with video debriefing, to deliver a practical learning experience supported by the latest academic thinking in investigative interviewing.
The module is intended to build on the interviewing skills developed during the Fundamentals of Accident Investigation, Applied Aircraft Accident Investigation, Applied Marine Accident Investigation and Applied Rail Accident Investigation modules. However, it can also be attended as a standalone module for delegates who wish to gain an enhanced qualification in investigative interviewing, and would be particularly suited to delegates with previous experience of conducting investigative interviews.
The module will have an emphasis on interviews forming part of safety (no blame/just culture) investigations of generic transport accidents. However, its content will be equally applicable to accident investigators from other safety critical domains and high reliability organisations, such as healthcare, process industries, and energy utilities.
Basic theory of memory and recall.
Enhanced theory of memory and psychology applied during investigative interviewing.
SE3R methodology for managing and recording interviews.
Introduction to concept of enhanced cognitive interview techniques, including free recall.
Biases and heuristics ‚Äì investigator and witnesses.
Introduction to non-cognitive interview techniques for interviewees who have not directly witnessed the accident.
Identification of the most appropriate interview technique to apply.
Identifying and employing appropriate challenge techniques for any inconsistencies/omissions during an interview.
Dealing with other third party attendees at the interview, e.g. legal representatives, trade union representatives, friends/family.
Strategies for conducting an effective self-critique of the interview process to ensure continuous performance improvement.
Demonstrate the ability to conduct an effective self-critique of the interview process to ensure continuous performance improvement.
The aim of this module is to provide students with an understanding of the design of crashworthy aircraft structures and the considerations necessary when designing safe and crashworthy aircraft. The main purpose of crashworthy design is to eliminate injuries and fatalities in mild impacts and minimise them in severe but survivable impacts.
Use simple approximate calculations on the performance of energy absorption components and structures to assess the crashworthiness of an aircraft structure.
The module will allow the delegate to have an understanding of the relevant regulations, legislation and legal processes, to be able to conduct their evidence collection according to methods of best practice, and to be confident and proficient in giving evidence in court. At the end of the module the students will undertake a mock courtroom exercise and be able to receive feedback on their performance from their peers.

2.	Define the role and responsibilities of the accident investigator as expert witness and demonstrate the ability to assess the best ways to execute this role.
3.	Compose accident reports which can be used appropriately by parallel investigation processes.
4.	Present oral evidence in court effectively and critically evaluate the experience.
5.	Respond effectively to cross-examination and critically evaluate the experience.
The module will allow the delegate to have an understanding of the relevant failure modes, be able to inspect wreckage to understand the most likely failure scenarios, and to be proficient in obtaining and evaluate the work supplied by material forensic specialists. At the end of the module the students will undertake simulated materials investigations and present their findings to their peers.
‚Ä¢	Fundamentals: The student will gain an understanding of the fundamentals of material behaviour, mode specific design philosophies, and principles related to material failures.
‚Ä¢	Failure modes of metallic materials: Fracture mechanisms and the resultant visual characteristics will be presented.
‚Ä¢	Failure modes of non-metallic materials: Fracture mechanisms and the resultant visual characteristics will be presented.
‚Ä¢	The process of structural investigations: Subject areas presented include the material investigation process; from the wreckage examination in the field to the laboratory investigation, sample removal and transportation, and the use of specialist laboratory equipment.
2.	Inspect a fracture surface to make a judgement on the failure scenario.
3.	Evaluate the information supplied from a forensic specialist on a failure scenario.
The course is primarily aimed at those involved in aircraft accident investigation and other safety related industries. Applicants should have a good UK honours degree (or equivalent) in any discipline, or a recognised lower qualification plus relevant work experience in aviation/safety related areas.
Applicants without a good UK honours degree (or equivalent) are encouraged to attend one or two modules (such as Fundamentals of Accident Investigation and Applied Aircraft Accident Investigation) as an Associate Student on a Continuing Professional Development course rather than applying as an MSc student. Please go to the Fundamentals of Accident Investigation CPD webpage.
Previous students have been employed by dedicated government investigation agencies, airframe and power plant manufacturers, air traffic services, safety regulation, insurers, and the military.

The URL of the last configuration file to be successfully loaded into memory. Return an empty string if this feature is not supported or the information is unavailable.
A descriptive status of any current failures of any of the persistent storage facilities on this entity. When this information is unavailable return a null string. 'operational' should be returned if there are no problems. Transitional information MAY be reported as well.
The MD5 message digest, as specified in RFC1321, for the persistent configuration information. This object MAY be used by management applications to detect changes to the configuration of the managed entity. If it is not possible to compute this value return an empty string.
The maximum number of configuration change requests this entity can hold in the etsysConfigMgmtChangeTable. A value of 0 indicates no configured limit.
The number of configuration change requests currently in the etsysConfigMgmtChangeTable.
The number of configuration change requests that have completed successfully or otherwise. This object should be stored in persistent memory.
The URLs that this entity supports for transferring files. These define the transfer protocols and remote file names. etsysConfigMgmtFtp - As per rfc1738 ftp://:@:/ url-path: //...//;type= user defaults to anonymous, password to snmp@, port to 21, and type to ASCII. binary and image are both valid types which have the same meaning. domain-name would be the IP address or domain name of the managed entity. etsysConfigMgmtRcp - rcp://@:///...// port defaults to 514. etsysConfigMgmtHttp - As per rfc1738 http://:/? port defaults to 80. etsysConfigMgmtTftp - tftp://:///...// port defaults to 69. etsysConfigMgmtFile - As per rfc1738 file:/// host can only be specified as localhost or the empty string. This will only be used to specify a file on the managed entity. This indicates that the managed entity supports some form of a user file system. etsysConfigMgmtBootP - bootp:// host specifies the default gateway, or bootp server that the bootp request should be directed to.
Configuration change operations that are supported on this managed entity. A managed entity should provide support only for the options that make sense given the capabilities of the entity and the desired level of manageability.
This object indicates the numerically lowest available index within this entity, which may be used for the value of etsysConfigMgmtChangeIndex in the creation of a new entry in the etsysConfigMgmtChangeTable. An index is considered available if the index value falls within the range of 1 to etsysConfigMgmtChangeLimit and is not being used to index an existing entry in the etsysConfigMgmtChangeTable contained within this entity. A value of zero indicates that all of the entries in the etsysConfigMgmtChangeTable are currently in use. This value should only be considered a guideline for management creation of etsysConfigMgmtChangeTable entries, there is no requirement on management to create entries based upon this index value.
A table that describes a single configuration change request.
An entry describing the configuration change request.
The index for this configuration change request.
The URL of the image, configuration file, or server to use for the requested operation. Any password information MUST NOT be returned on a read. Any errors with the type or format of this object SHOULD be reported in the etsysConfigMgmtChangeErrorDescription object when the row is activated.
The operation or operations requested. The specification of any unsupported operations SHOULD cause the entire operation to fail immediately and an appropriate error description to be generated.
The operational state of the configuration request. inactive - Indicates that the RowStatus of this conceptual row is not in the `active` state. pending - Indicates that the configuration change described by this row is ready to run and waiting in a queue. running - Indicates that the configuration change described by this row is running. success - Indicates that the configuration change described by this row has successfully run to completion. failure - Indicates that the configuration change described by this row has failed to run to completion.
The number of seconds that should elapse between the time that the RowStatus of this conceptual row is set to active and the request is queued for execution. On a read this object should return the time remaining before the request is queued.
The date and time, in device local time, when this change request was last enqueued for execution. The value '0000000000000000'H is returned if this table entry has not yet been queued.
The date and time, in device local time, when this change request was last completed. It should be reset to the default value when the RowStatus of this conceptual row is set to active. The value '0000000000000000'H is returned if this table entry has not yet run to completion.
The number of bytes currently transferred. A value of -1 indicates that this feature is not supported for the protocol currently selected. This value is reset to its initial state when the etsysConfigMgmtRowStatus object is set to the active state.
A checksum, fingerprint, message-digest, or some other means to validate the integrity of the file.
This object contains a descriptive error message if the requested transfer failed. Implementations must reset the error message to a zero-length string when the etsysConfigMgmtChangeRowStatus leaf is set to the active state.
A control that will allow one entry to be added, activated, deactivated, and removed from this table. When the value of this object is 'active' none of the other objects in this conceptual row can be modified. Setting this object to the 'active' state from the 'notInService' state will cause the requested configuration operation to be initiated. Once the requested configuration operation has completed, successfully or otherwise, this leaf will be set to the 'notInService' state by the managed entity. Setting this object to any other valid state from the 'active' state SHOULD cause the managed entity to cancel the requested operation at its earliest most rational opportunity. Setting this object to the 'active' state from the 'active' state SHOULD NOT have any affect. Conceptual rows that have been in the 'notInService' state for more than a device specific time period MAY be destroyed by the managed entity.
Objects that provide some status information about the entity's current configuration.
Objects that provide a means to change the entity's configuration.
The compliance statement for entities which implement the Enterasys Configuration Management MIB. Implementation of this MIB is based on individual product needs.

It seems like over the coarse of a weekend, Central Park went from fresh, green leaves to brilliant shades of fiery red and golden ombres. With candy corn and pumpkin pies now being old news (but so yummy), November is well and truly off and running.
Saks has already adorned their first floor with their trademark garland, sparking the urge for peppermint lattes and window gazing. Knowing the big apple typically becomes an ice block in December/January, I relish this time of year, when layering can actually be cute and walks in Central Park are paved with golden leaves vs. mounds of snow.

James Newitt‚Äôs exhibition is fragmented, divided into parts evoking concepts and metaphors of Heterotopias and of Plato‚Äôs Cave. Moving and still images ‚Äì a video installation and photographs ‚Äì are combined with texts and drawings in the form of a screenplay and a series of ‚Äòmindmaps‚Äô, presented inside and on the glass fa√ßade of the space. The light from the videos merges with diluted daylight, an effect created by covering the gallery‚Äôs windows with a reflective film. The video which, is projected on both sides of a suspended screen, depicts two young boxers training alone in front of a mirror. The young men only confront each other in an imagined space. The movement of the camera as it films, circling the protagonist, anticipates the movement of viewers around the screen ‚Äì which produces further reflections in the windows of the gallery space. The viewer positions themselves physically and mentally within the range of heterotopias of a boxing club and an art space, both occurring on the frayed edges of their areas of action and their common location in the outskirts of Lisbon. The reflections of bodies in the impossible ‚Äòthere‚Äô of the reflected image in the mirror merging with the ‚Äòreal‚Äô image of the Alta de Lisboa landscape which exists just beyond the frame.
I resisted buying a cell phone. The car was one of my last refuges from people.
I bought one, and moved to a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone soon after.
Now I have to decide when to leave it in the truck when I get home so I won‚Äôt answer it. I leave it in the charger so that the battery will last when I go to bed at night. It is no different from when I was a student. If I chose a table in the main part of the library to study, I knew I was open to socializing. It was the code. I have spend plenty of non-productive hours in the library.
I then learned to find great hiding places where I worked when I chose to focus, and amazing things followed. The only difference is that the ‚Äúpreserve‚Äù around solitude used to be much greater, if that makes sense. With a phone in your pocket, bike pack, back pack or purse, the ‚Äúpreserve‚Äù is as small as your personal interaction zone. Small.
WITH that I have noticed an image coming in through sci-fi and other sources: the hive or interconnected mentality where one participates in the inmost thoughts of thousands. It was in the Borg in Star Trek, it will come again in Card‚Äôs vision for the enemy in Ender‚Äôs Game.
Think about it. We have this desire (many of us) to share intimacy, to share ourselves with others (Facebook, Pinterest, all the new sites) and we think it may be possible somewhere out there.
Christians found something as close as humanly possible in the beginning of Christianity and coined a word for it ‚Äî koinonia ‚Äî the concept of fellowship that is intimate and powerful.
So how do you balance the two? The thirst for some solitude and some sense of belonging to others and possibly to something big? I don‚Äôt know a lot, but I know that both take work. Both demand time.
Both are worth it. And my saying that may be an almost unconscionable grace. I am grateful if it is.
The Marines are apologizing for a well-intentioned Christmas gift gone wrong that has upset the families of about 1,150 fallen Marines and sailors who received a Purple Heart Christmas tree ornament in the mail addressed to their deceased loved one.
Late last week the Marine's Wounded Warrior Regiment mailed about 9,000 Christmas ornaments donated by the Semper Fi Fund, a charitable organization. The ornaments were intended for post 9/11 living Marine recipients of the Purple Heart, which is the award given to service members wounded in combat. Sailors awarded the Purple Heart while attached to or serving in support of Marine Corps units were to also receive the brass ornaments that contain an image of the Purple Heart in the center.
However, the regiment's list of Purple Heart recipients did not distinguish between the names of living and deceased recipients of the medal. That meant about 1,150 families of fallen Marines and sailors also received the ornament in packages addressed to their deceased loved one.
The regiment apologized to the families today after it began to receive calls Monday night from family members distressed about how the packages had been addressed.
"There are no words to express how very sorry we are for the hurt such a mistake has caused the families of our fallen warriors," Col. John L. Mayer, the regiment's commanding officer, said in a statement. "We always strive to honor the sacrifices these Marines, sailors and their families gave to this country.
"There is no excuse for why this happened," he said. "We accept full responsibility for this error and are moving quickly to reach out to the families we have affected."
"The intention was to thank Purple Heart recipients for their service," said Capt. Jill Wolf, a spokeswoman for the Wounded Warrior Regiment, which assists non-medical care to injured Marines, sailors and their families as they return to duty or transition to civilian life.
The regiment is sending letters of apology to the families of fallen Marines and sailors included in the mailing and Mayer is personally calling the families who contacted the regiment.
Wolf said that the Marine Corps began to receive calls from the families of fallen Marines on Monday as the packages began to arrive in the mail. By this evening, 35 families had contacted the Marines, with the majority expressing shock that the packages had been addressed to their loved ones and asking to be removed from the list.
She said there had also been some positive feedback from some families who wanted the Marines to know how much the ornament had meant to them, but who also asked to be removed from the list.
High Quality Entry level Kendo uniform for everyday practices. The Kendogi is made of a single layer, 100% Cotton, dark navy blue fabric.

If you are starting Kendo, or need an extra set of uniforms, this is the one to get.
Light Weight Hakama will be discontinued.
This Kendogi is 100% Cotton, dark navy blue.
The shoulder has a reinforcement that will protect from rubbing with the Do Himo.
Nice set, I bought for a Kid and, for training, that set is satisfactory.
I'm happy with the quality of the product and the customer service I received when ordering. The nice people at e-bogu were helpful with finding the right fit (I'm a large person) and making sure that the embroidery was correct. Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase.
UPDATE: I've used this uniform for over six years now. It's been pretty well abused during that time, but it's hanging in there just fine. The colour doesn't fade in the same way as a shoaizome dyed uniform. The hakama have turned a fairly even medium blue, while the gi has faded more unevenly, and with an almost purple tint in the most faded areas. The fabric has held together nicely, with no worn out areas or tears, and the little strings for tying it closed are still intact. The areas where the dou himo cross over my shoulders has not worn out like I've seen on other gi of comparable age. It is functional and durable in its old age, if not as pretty as a traditionally dyed set.
Great attention and great quality product!
Fast shipping, and great quality product!
Keikogi quite suitable for the hot Caribbean climate. Decent quality for the price.

So. It‚Äôs quiet around here. The Girl and her Dad-O took off for cooler temperatures and more entertaining people last week, leaving me with a wide open schedule to take this test prep by the horns. I finished the Doctors in Training Step 1 review course (15 days, 3 lectures per day) and am reading and doing questions most of the day now. This morning my friend and I did a dry run to the testing center; we even did some reconnaissance regarding temperature and lockers inside. I‚Äôm not ready to take the test yet, but I have a week to review and plane tickets for the next morning, so there‚Äôs no turning back now!
Have you ever spent a week away from your child? Because I hadn‚Äôt. I think the longest we‚Äôve been apart approached 5 days once, until this time. The first couple of days I did a lot of milling around and not sleeping ‚Äì put it on my tab ‚Äì but was able to put about half of those extra hours toward studying. They return tomorrow, thank goodness. Every Mom yearns for alone time and lots of space to stretch out and be comfortable and do whatever she pleases. Did I appreciate the opportunity? Yes, and I‚Äôve been productive. But I‚Äôve grown accustomed to their faces and am disoriented without them here.
In their absence, Chief has stepped up been here to receive my extra love and ramblings. (BTW, I still can‚Äôt believe this happened.) We‚Äôve gone on long walks with Goljan audio and frequented the dog park. New landscaping has meant water runoff into the dog park, creating fantastic mud pits for wallowing. So we‚Äôve had a few baths. Confirming Joel‚Äôs suspicions that his main objective in life is to be in everyone‚Äôs way, he has avoided the bed for all but a few hours the whole week. Without Joel‚Äôs long frame to impede, what point would there be?
Enough of my lonesome musings and avoidance of First Aid. I gotta make today count!
good luck! hope you are well!

FORT BRAGG, N.C. ‚Äî Bowe Bergdahl, the Army sergeant who walked off his post in Afghanistan and triggered a search that wounded some of his comrades, will serve no prison time, a military judge ruled Friday at the end of the politically divisive case that stirred debate during the president campaign.
The charges centered on a decision by one soldier that affected many other lives. Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban and held for five years, until President Barack Obama traded Taliban prisoners to bring him back. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump called for Bergdahl to face stiff punishment. He could have received up to life in prison.
The judge also gave Bergdahl a dishonorable discharge, reduced his rank to private and ordered him to forfeit pay equal to $1,000 per month for 10 months. The judge made no other comments.
The defense sought to counter that evidence with testimony about Bergdahl's suffering as a captive, his contributions to military intelligence and survival training and his mental health problems. The argument for leniency also cited harsh campaign-trail criticism by Trump.
The White House said it had no comment on the sentence and referred back to a statement from several weeks ago that said Trump expects everyone in the military justice system "to exercise their independent professional judgment, consistent with applicable laws and regulations."
A punitive discharge deprives Bergdahl of most or all his veterans' benefits.
Capt. Nina Banks, a defense attorney, said it would not be justice to rescue Bergdahl from the Taliban "only to place him in a cell" now.
Bergdahl "does not have a monopoly on suffering as a result of his choices," Maj. Justin Oshana said.
At the time of Bergdahl's release, Obama said the U.S. does not leave its service members on the battlefield. Republicans roundly criticized Obama, and Trump went further while campaigning for president, repeatedly calling Bergdahl a traitor who deserved serious punishment.

At first glance, Fukuoka seems like a peaceful city, but under the surface, crime is running rampant. The cityÔøΩs Hakata ward is home to the professionals of the underworld: professional killers, detectives, informants, professional revenge seekers, those skilled in torture, and more. And according to urban legend, even a killer of professional killers exists in the city. When stories of the men in the underworld are told, a professional killer murder appears.
Some business trends are long-lasting and withstand changing attitudes and the tests of time. Others are fleeting and quickly replaced by the next fad to catch headlines. However, one business trend that‚Äôs not going away anytime soon is the impact of technology and culture.
Company culture is important to the success of any company and its employees. In a survey of global CEOs, culture was named one of the top five factors affecting long-term company value. When technology and culture intersect, companies experience a range of benefits, from improved employee engagement and productivity to enhanced career development opportunities.
Company culture is more than a dress code or tradition of celebrating coworkers‚Äô birthdays. It encompasses the entire mission and values of the organization, as well as the aggregate of employee attitudes and behaviors.
In the digital age, technology has transformed workplaces around the globe. Collaboration tools bring remote teams closer together on projects, and big data and AI have elevated business activities like employee recruitment and client engagement.
Technology helps promote company culture by improving employee productivity and making jobs easier. For example, a sales manager with a powerful CRM no longer has to spend time poring over manual sales records. Instead, the manager can use that time to connect and build relationships with direct reports and clients. When the manager has more time to make connections with others, a culture based on mutual respect, trust, and teamwork has the opportunity to thrive.
Technology also improves communication between employees, which helps promote a culture of collaboration and inclusion. Social messaging tools, video conferences, and company chat platforms allow individuals and teams to share ideas and solve problems together, instead of allowing silos to form.
Make it relevant: Select technology solutions that are relevant and help employees work smarter. Implementing a tech solution that isn‚Äôt the best fit for your organization may actually cause employees to become less productive and engaged.
Reward employees who support the culture: Consider employee development tools like gamified reward systems or performance feedback platforms that provide healthy incentives for employees to support the culture. Two-way feedback tools not only engage employees but also let them have a say in how the culture evolves.
Bring the culture alive: Live org charts help employees see and understand company culture by helping them put a name to a face and see exactly where their role fits within the larger context of the organization.
When combined, technology and culture can ignite employee productivity and engagement, transforming how individuals execute and collaborate in the workplace. Every organization is different, thus some tech tools may be more relevant than others. However, no matter your company‚Äôs size or industry, the powerful mix of technology and culture can revolutionize internal processes and systems, and breathe new life into your organization.

Beard is the collection of hair around the cheeks and chin. A well groomed beard can be a sign of well being as it can be a sign of high self esteem or ego to some people. One thing you need to know is everyone can grow the beard but many people consider it as a sign of unprofessionalism in certain careers or professions but that is not the case because a beard cannot hinder you from working no matter how long and how groomed the beard really is. Growing a beard sometimes requires a lot of commitment and one must have what it takes and be willing to grow it.
-Why should one grow a beard?
One can grow a beard for very many reasons, one of the most reasons men grow a beard for is to look more attractive to potential partners. A well groomed beard can also make one look very masculine and even in the event of a competition one who has a beard is considered to have a competitive edge in some places. Also some men grow beards to raise money for cancer and this is one way that a beard can help you reach out to the society.
Now let us talk about how you can grow a beard. Growing the beard of your choice will require commitment that is one thing you should be willing to do. Leave the beard alone after you take on growing it. Do not shave for at least three weeks or four, this will help the beard grow long enough o get to the point of trimming it so do not start shaving because it might be too soon. To many people shaving a beard is normal while growing the beard is an exception but when you want to grow the beard, the vice versa mostly applies.
Be patient and leave the beard alone to grow. Do not start trimming too early just because you are anxious to see how it will come out as. Instead be patient and let it grow to a length that will be easier to trim and if you just happen to over trim it do not give up at least not yet give it another chance and another if need be.
After growing the beard that is not the end of it all, you should maintain it well by trimming it to the length you want and cleaning it regularly. Use a beard trimmer to trim your beard and also wash it using shampoo mostly the one you use to wash you head with is recommended. Dry your beard well with a towel after cleaning it and if possible you can even blow dry it. Though it is not a must you blow dry it you can do it at least once in a month or so but you can also do it daily if you like.

Home ¬ª Our Team ¬ª What is An Oncologist?
Oncologists are specialist doctors who focus on the non-surgical management of cancer. Generally, Oncologists are either trained in Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy or Both methods of cancer treatment.
In Singapore‚Äôs context, internal medicine physicians who wish to pursue a career in medical oncology continue with on-the-job specialist training to become ‚Äòmedical oncology‚Äô specialists who focus on using chemotherapy to treat cancer patients. They do not provide radiation treatments for their patients. This is why unlike their American board-certified colleagues, medical oncologists from Singapore hold the MRCP qualification just like other internal medicine specialists.
Training for radiotherapy is undertaken via 2 tracks, namely the Australian or the British system. The Australian system focuses only on radiotherapy and after obtaining qualifications and training in radiation oncology, candidates become ‚Äòradiation oncology‚Äô specialists. The British system is a comprehensive qualification in Clinical Oncology called ‚ÄòFRCR in Clinical Oncology‚Äô requiring training and competency in both Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy. Upon obtaining the FRCR in Clinical Oncology qualification and satisfying training requirements in Singapore, candidates become ‚Äòradiation oncology‚Äô specialists.
In summary, there are 2 types of Oncology specialists recognized by the Specialist Accreditation Board in Singapore, namely the medical oncologist and the radiation oncologist. The medical oncologist is trained only in chemotherapy and does not provide radiotherapy for their patients. All radiation oncologists are specialists who are at the minimum trained in radiotherapy, while those with the Clinical Oncology qualification are dual trained in chemotherapy as well.
In this era of rapid advancement, a broad-based education coupled with a sub-specialised team approach is the only way cancer patients can receive the most updated treatments for their condition.
It was a rainy day when two crazy creative minds met by chance. The immediate empathy led them to collaborate on different projects, creating a strong successful understanding and, above all, the desire to undertake an independent path together.

She is a contributing journalist, dedicating her free time to her private life and meeting new people sharing the same thirst for knowledge with the right dose of madness. She keeps herself well away from nature as its full of insects, she adores city life, shopping mall, cats and roller skates. She also loves surprises, only nice ones though.

Consulting engineers are being confused by apparently conflicting requirements between local planning officers and the most recent changes to Part L of the Building Regulations, according to experts.
Although the carbon reduction targets set by the revised Part L (2013) are modest ‚Äì just 6 per cent for new homes and 9 per cent for commercial buildings ‚Äì they should improve insulation levels and this could reduce the effectiveness of renewables.
‚ÄúHigher insulation standards will reduce the need for heat, but renewables depend on heat demand to operate,‚Äù said David Shaw, LZC national sales manager for Baxi Commercial Division.
Mr Shaw believes this is driving designers to make perverse technology choices that may not be in the interests of the building owner or operator.
‚ÄúWe are seeing terrible mis-matches because designers are getting confused ‚Äì and even worse, they don‚Äôt always recognise the impact of making the wrong choices. It is important that designers make sure they are specifying an appropriate solution for the building and not just ticking boxes,‚Äù added Mr Shaw.
This article is pretty misleading. Where authorities have a renewable energy requirement, this is expressed as % (usually 10%) reduction (post implementation of Part L requirements). Hence, the 2013 Part L improvement reduces the remaining % reduction that must be achieved via renewables. And no local authority demands that the renewable system must be heat producing (why not PV?). In any case, many authorities have moved away from renewables requirements to a simple % CO2 reduction beyond Part L (whether achieved with or without renewables). The 2013 Part L requirements were watered down from the original proposals to reach the energy requirement for Code Level 4 - so still plenty of scope for CO2 reduction whether from renewables or not.

Gambling laws vary widely from one country to the next. Sometimes the laws about casinos, online gaming, bonus codes and other betting activities are dictated by the country's leaders. In other cases the decisions were made based on the majority's religious beliefs.
In any case, it's a good idea to know about a country's gambling laws before you plan a trip.
In the United States, gambling laws are set by the individual states. Most states operate a lottery but Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nevada and Utah do not have Powerballs or any other type of State Lottery.
For many decades, land-based casinos were only allowed to operate in Nevada; but over the last few decades, many other states have passed legislation that enables brick-and-mortar casinos to operate within their borders ‚Äì these include Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Colorado, Michigan, West Virginia, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, New York, Mississippi, Louisiana and Indiana.
Native American Tribes may run casinos in states that allow casino gambling without oversight of state regulators. Congress regulates Indian casinos which frees them from state laws and state supervision. Indian tribes may operate casinos only in states where casinos are allowed to operate.
A recent Supreme Court ruling has given states the opportunity to legislate sports betting. Until May 2018 only Delaware and Nevada were allowed to offer sports betting since they did so before anti-sports betting legislation was passed in the 1990s. With the Supreme Court ruling new states will be allowed to offer sports betting opportunities.
A part the State of New Jersey (here a list of sites authorized by the NJ Division of Gaming Enforcement), Online betting is still illegal in the United States under laws that control money-laundering that may pass through online banks to and from online casinos. Those laws may also be challenged in the near future.
Gambling in Canada is regulated by local provinces. Each province has its own Gaming Corporation which runs under the auspices of the province's Finance Ministry. These Gaming Corporations regulate the casinos, the lotteries and any other gambling activities, including charitable gambling, that occurs in the province.
The Interprovincial Lottery Corporation (ILC) operates Canadian lottery games. It is owned by the five provincial lottery commissions ‚Äì Ontario Lottery, Quebec Lottery, British Columbia Lottery, Atlantic Lottery (serving the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick) and the Western Canada Lottery (serving provinces of Manitoba, Alberta, Nunavut, Nortwest Territories and Yukon and Saskatchewan.
The ILC administers 4 games (Lotto 4/69, Lotto Max, Daily Grand and Celebration). Provincial Lottery Corporations market the national games as well as their own provincial games.
Online gambling in Canada is legal. Many of the provincial lottery Corporations offer their own online activities including options to buy lottery tickets online and options to play games online. Offshore casino gaming is legal in Canada. The Quebec provincial government is attempting to limit such offshore gambling activities in order to bolster its own Quebec Lottery but it has not been successful since doing so would violate the country's free Internet laws.
In the UK there are multiple gambling opportunities for people 18 and older including adult gaming centers, betting shops, brick-and-mortar casinos, bingo halls, racetracks and online gambling. There is also a National Lottery, lottery and football pools which are open to individuals aged 16 and older.
Many of the betting centers (the old corner bookies) have installed gaming machines such as slots, poker machines and roulette machines. These machines are very popular and provide the greater part of the shops' income, above and beyond the wagers that are placed on sports events and other types of bets.
Online gaming is growing in popularity in the UK. It's legal for offshore casinos to offer gaming options for UK residents and many of the large betting companies (such as William Hill and Ladbrokes) see this as cutting into the profits that they realize from their betting shops.
It's estimated that more than 80% of Australian adults engage in some type of gambling on a regular basis. Statisticians say that this represents the highest rate of gambling in the world. The Australian gambling laws are extremely liberal which makes it easy for Aussies to enjoy a wide range of casino gambling activities.
Land-based casinos, state and territory lotteries and racetrack gambling are regulated by the individual states and territories. The Interactive Gambling Act of 2001 outlawed offshore casinos from offering gambling activities to people located in Australia. Fines could be levied against the casinos but not the players so Australian citizens continue to play at these online casinos since the casinos continue to offer gaming options for Aussies.
The New Zealand Ministry of Health, via the Department of Internal Affairs, regulates gambling in conjunction with the Gambling Commission. These agencies are charged with ensuring that New Zealand gamers have access to safe, secure and fair online and land-based casino gaming. The agencies monitor brick-and-mortar casinos, racetrack betting, lotteries, sports betting and online casinos.
NZ gambling legislation is enforced by the NZ Department of Internal Affairs. The Ministry of Health funds and coordinates services for people with obsessive gambling behaviors. The Gambling Commission licenses land-based casinos.
The NZ government does not regulate "offshore" casinos. Kiwis have unlimited access to these freemarket casino sites.

Looking for a Maryland Wedding DJ ?
Bay Deejays is a Baltimore-based boutique-style entertainment firm that concentrates only on helping our clients plan and execute 100% perfect wedding ceremonies and receptions. When I started the company, I already had more than a decade of experience in the mobile DJ business and had already entertained at hundreds of weddings, corporate events, proms, mitzvahs, night clubs, and various other private parties doing business as Jason Walsh Entertainment.
While I enjoyed the variety of events I booked, it soon became clear that I was being referred by the area's leading venues, top wedding vendors, and most importantly - by my past clients, for my ability to pack a wedding reception dance floor from start to finish. Along with good friends and exclusive subcontractors, Chris Hart and Bob Sigmon, Bay Deejays took shape in 2009 and from our first year, we were recognized among the Top 5% of all DJs in the Baltimore Metro area by WeddingWire (a leading national wedding planning website and print magazine) - an award that Bay Deejays has proudly won every year since our inception.
Today, I'm honored that my Baltimore-based small business holds a perfect 100% client satisfaction rating on WeddingWire and The Knot and that Bay Deejays is recommended by top destination venues such as The Chesapeake Bay Beach Club and the Tidewater Inn.
Wedding planning doesn't have to be difficult... When my wife and I look back at our own planning journey - the one thing that was missing from many wedding vendors, unfortunately, was transparency. Upfront pricing, honesty, and good communications are something I valued as a wedding client, and these are things I promise to all of our couples. If you don't immediately feel like you "click" with any wedding vendor your interview, you should probably continue looking. If a vendor is hiding their pricing, they are likely trying to see how many "extras" they can sell you. I post my prices and proudly advertise that no, I am not the cheapest guy in town - but I do have a list of hundreds of satisfied clients that have told me and other wedding vendor review readers, "Bay Deejays was the overall best investment for our wedding!"
If you are looking to host a fun, but also classy, wedding reception and want a DJ and MC that will: entertain all of your guests, make energetic (but not cheesy) announcements and event transitions, and provide you with one-on-one planning guidance and best practices from over 1,000 successful weddings, I'd love to meet with you and your fiance/fiancee/partner.
The wheel is supposed to be the biggest invention of humankind. After its invention, new machines and vehicles were invented to reduce the distances between two places. The car is the most used personal mode of transportation in daily life and BMW is one of the biggest names in the auto industry.
BMW is renowned for its style, class, elegance and quality. Furthermore, BMW is also acknowledged for its innovation and comfort. BMW, as expected, has taken a step ahead in this modern world of technology by using the HERE Location Platform.
The HERE Location Platform works in quite an efficient way by allowing a navigating device be connected to the public internet sources in cities. The information gathered allows the system to update information being displayed in real time. The information can collaborate with other drivers for better results in traffic information. Eventually, autonomous driving will depend on this type of this real-time data source.
A driver can use HERE location platform for various purposes. First, this system can be integrated with the GPS system to locate the path to your destination. Next, this technology can be used to understand the apparent condition of your car to determine whether it‚Äôs mechanically safe to travel. Furthermore, this device is also connected to your smartphone to give you information about the location of your car when you are away from it. Another beautiful aspect of this technology is that it will not let you forget your important meetings and events. Since the system is connected to your smartphone and social media, it will keep updating your schedule.
Suppose, you‚Äôre traveling to a city very far from your home, this smart system will get the weather updates from the internet about that town and can inform you about the precautions to be taken. It can also provide you the information about the traffic conditions. HERE location platform is also capable of giving you the contact details of different emergency services nearby.
There are many benefits which one can enjoy using this technology connected to the Internet. The HERE location platform technology has laid down the foundation for comfortable and tension-free driving experiences.

Just before takeoff, I notice something different about the passengers aboard my Cathay Pacific flight, direct from New York to Hong Kong: Their airborne ensembles seem to be preplanned. There are metallic parkas, rhinestone-laden Gucci eyewear, and carry-on baggage far more stylish than my beaten-up duffle. I expected the Hong Kong crowd to be well-heeled, but all was revealed when I overheard a brash man take a phone call from the tarmac. ‚ÄúWhat time is the vernissage?‚Äù he pressed.
Art world power players were descending upon the city for Art Basel Hong Kong and so, too, were the revelers who enjoy all of the fair‚Äôs peripheral celebrations. Like its other iterations in Miami and Basel, Switzerland, the weeklong calendar of events is more than just an art fair; buyers abound and circulate at dinners, there are artist meet and greets aplenty, and, yes, more than a handful of vernissages.
But at last night‚Äôs amfAR Hong Kong Gala, all eyes were on the grand ballroom; its curvaceous candlelit staircase was covered in greenery and served as the perfect welcome to local and international guests alike, who were experiencing the highly anticipated property for the very first time.
Throughout the evening, the crowd certainly showed their spending power, particularly when it came to the evening‚Äôs auction led by Simon de Pury. ‚ÄúThere are a number of motivated buyers and collectors here tonight,‚Äù he said tactfully. The red-hot lots that were up at the auction block included a pair of Lorraine Schwartz sapphire earrings (modeled by Heidi Klum), which were sold for $50,000, and an abstract work by Eddie Martinez, entitled Night Flight, which, after much fanfare, was ultimately sold for $260,000.
Among the paddle-wielding bidders was Adrian Cheng, the evening‚Äôs honoree who happily walked away with a sculpture by Erwin Wurm for a cool $160,000 before being recognized for his contributions toward the eradication of AIDS. Welcomed onstage by frequent collaborators Pharrell and gallerist Rachel Lehmann, Cheng graciously accepted his award before rallying the crowd to continue their soaring donations.

Regardless of the condition of your marriage right now, it can get better and God will help you in that effort.
The marriage relationship is the most important human relationship we‚Äôll ever experience. God said the love shared in marriage is comparable to the love Christ has for the church (see Ephesians 5:22-33). Knowing this, it would make sense that God has given us the ability to grow stronger in our marriages. Regardless of the condition of your marriage right now, it can get better and God will help you in that effort.
In 1 Peter 3:7, God tells us husbands to dwell with our wives ‚Äúwith understanding.‚Äù Sometimes we men may feel like we‚Äôll never be able to properly relate to our wife, we‚Äôll never really understand what makes her tick. But God says you can. With His help, you can increase in your understanding of this unique woman. It won‚Äôt always be easy, but the rewards that come from your efforts will make it a great investment!
To the wives, God says to show respect for your husband (see Ephesians 5:33). This is something you must choose to do, not something you‚Äôll necessarily feel like doing. When a man feels respected by his wife, he will usually respond in a more respectful and loving manner. When he feels disrespected, he will often react in a negative manner. While you can‚Äôt control your husband‚Äôs responses, you can greatly influence him by the way you respond to him.
Let your spouse be who he/she was meant to be. You can‚Äôt control your spouse, because you were never meant to. The Bible did not say ‚ÄúControl your spouse.‚Äù To the husbands, God said, ‚ÄúLove your wife.‚Äù To the wives, God said, ‚ÄúRespect your husband.‚Äù The way we respond to our spouse influences them greatly, but does not control them. As we obey God, our spouse will be influenced and will eventually respond. Reap what you sow.

I‚Äôve just found out it‚Äôs National Library‚Äôs Day today and I couldn‚Äôt let it go unmarked. Both my Mum and Dad were librarians, in fact they met on their library course in their late teens/early twenties. Mum went back to her career as a librarian after she had brought up me and Alex, and became the School Librarian at Our Lady‚Äôs in Royton. She stayed there for twenty five years until she retired in December 2010 and the above photo was taken by me on her last day. Mum loved a good display and Christmas provided her with no end of literary inspiration. Check out a couple of 2010‚Ä≤s displays below‚Ä¶.
In my opinion Mum was an excellent school librarian, fostering a love of books and a thirst for knowledge in the students. Her library also provided a safe haven for young people who didn‚Äôt always feel part of school life.
Mum didn‚Äôt drive so one of my favourite things to do was to turn up at her library and surprise her with a lift home. I can still see her face as she spotted me and the delight on her face at the thought of not having to get the bus!! Ah the simple things.
If you or your children aren‚Äôt members of a library, I‚Äôd encourage you to rectify this immediately! Especially if you live in Oldham as we have an excellent library, life long learning centre and gallery with lot of free activities.

Aftermath of explosion at school in Farah, April 16, 2019.
Around 1,000 girls used to study at the school, from grade 1 to 12, in Nawda village, 20 kilometres from provincial capital, also Farah.
Mohammad Azimi, the provincial education director, said that unknown individuals entered the school late last night and fully destroyed with explosives.
He said that it was not immediately clear who was behind the attack, adding an investigation was underway.
Meanwhile, Abdul Rahman, the principal of the school, said that all the documents and books at the school were burnt following the explosion.
The school was second two be blown up in Farah in just two days.
The previous one targeted was in Tiosak village in the provincial capital.
Locals blamed groups with ties to the Taliban, but the Taliban denied responsibility for both the attacks.
We recently met with Hospitality Technology magazine to share insights about emerging technology trends for the publication‚Äôs annual research study: The 2018 Lodging Technology Study.
In this year‚Äôs study, integration moved up from 24% (in 2017), to 30%, as a top challenge faced by IT departments. Interestingly, the rapid pace of technological change demands that technology leaders evaluate and identify opportunities for continual improvement. According to Agilisys‚Äôs VP of Products and Customer Support, better integration is of strategic importance.
Hoteliers should expect all of their hospitality solutions to work in harmony. Property management technology is at the core of every hotel and resort, and while it helps drive a frictionless guest experience, it should also offer seamless integration with ancillary technologies. It must integrate and share data transparently throughout the enterprise. This provides the most flexibility to deliver a unique and memorable experience for guests while increasing the efficiency of hotel operations.
Agilysys delivers leading hospitality technology with comprehensive, seamless integration capabilities.

This is part 1 of the ‚ÄúHow Unreal Renders a Frame‚Äù series, you can access part 2 and part 3 as well.
I was looking around the Unreal source the other day and inspired by some excellent breakdowns of how popular games render a frame, I thought to try something similar with it as well, to study how it renders a frame (with the default settings/scene setup).
Since we have access to the source code, it is possible to study the renderer source to see what it does, although it is quite a beast and rendering paths depend a lot on the context so a clean, low-level API call list will be easier to follow (looking into the code to fill in any missing gaps).
I put together a simple scene with a few static and dynamic props, a few lights, volumetric fog, transparent objects and a particle effect to cover a large enough range of materials and rendering methods.
Disclaimer: the following analysis is based on the GPU capture and renderer source code (version 4.17.1), without prior Unreal experience really. If have missed something, or got anything wrong, please let me know in the comments.
Helpfully, Unreal‚Äôs draw call list is clean and well annotated so it should make our work easier. The list can look different in case you are missing some entities/materials in your scene or you are targeting lower quality. For example if you are rendering no particles, the ParticleSimulation passes will be missing.
The SlateUI render pass includes all API calls the Unreal Editor performs to render its UI so we will ignore it, focusing instead on all passes under Scene.
In this case the particle effect I added to the scene seems to have two emitters that require GPU simulation without collision, so the corresponding rendering passes can be run early in the frame.
It is worth noting the Unreal uses reverse-Z when rendering to the depth buffer, meaning that the near plane is mapped to 1 and the far plane to 0. This allows for better precision along the depth range and reduces z-fighting on distant meshes. The name of the rendering pass suggests that the pass was triggered by a ‚ÄúDBuffer‚Äù. This refers to the decal buffer Unreal Engine uses to render deferred decals. This requires the scene depth so it activates the Z-prepass. The z-buffer is used in other contexts though, such as for occlusion calculations and screen space reflections as we will see next.
Some render passes in the list appear to be empty, like the ResolveSceneDepth, which I guess is for platforms that actually need ‚Äúresolving‚Äù a rendertarget before using it as a texture (the PC doesn‚Äôt) as well as ShadowFrustumQueries which looks like it is a dummy marker, as the actual occlusion tests for shadows take place in the next render pass.
We create an occlusion query, issue it and render the prop we wish to determine occlusion for. This is done using a z-test and the depth buffer we produced in step 1. The query will return the number of pixels that passed the z-test, so if it is zero this means that the prop is behind a solid mesh. Since rendering a full prop mesh for occlusion can be expensive, we typically use the bounding box of that prop as a proxy. If it is not visible, then the prop is definitely not visible.
We read the query results back to the CPU and based on the number of pixels rendered we can decide to submit the prop for rendering or not (even if a small number of pixels are visible we might decide that it is not worth rendering the prop).
Hardware occlusion queries have disadvantages such as they have ‚Äúdrawcall‚Äù granularity meaning that they require the renderer to submit one drawcall per mesh (or mesh batches) that needs determining occlusion for, which can increase the number of drawcalls per frame significantly, they require CPU-readback which introduces CPU-GPU sync points and makes the CPU wait until the GPU has finished processing the query. They are not that great for instanced geometry as well but we‚Äôll ignore this for now.
The CPU-GPU sync point problem Unreal solves like any other engine that uses queries, by deferring reading the query data for a number of frames. This approach works, although it might introduce props popping in the screen with a fast moving camera (in practice it might not be a massive problem though since doing occlusion culling using bounding boxes is conservative, meaning that a mesh will in all likelihood be marked as visible before it actually is). The additional drawcall overhead problem remains though and it is not easy to solve. Unreal tries mitigate it by grouping queries like this: At first it renders all opaque geometry to the z-buffer (the Z-prepass discussed earlier). Then it issues individual queries for every prop it needs to test for occlusion. At the end of the frame it retrieves query data from the previous (or further back) frame and decides prop visibility. If it is visible it marks it as renderable for the next frame. On the other hand, if it is invisible, it adds it to a ‚Äúgrouped‚Äù query which batches the bounding boxes of up to 8 props and uses that to determine visibility during the next frame. If the group becomes visible next frame (as a whole), it breaks it up and issues individual queries again. If the camera and the props are static (or slowly moving), this approach reduces the number of necessary occlusion queries by a factor of 8. The only weirdness I noticed was during the batching of the occluded props which seems to be random and not based of spatial proximity.
This process corresponds to the IndividualQueries and GroupedQueries markers in the renderpass list above. The GroupedQueries part is empty as the engine did not manage to produce any during the previous frame.
Finally I assume that PlanarReflectionQueries refers to occlusion tests performed when calculating planar reflections (produced by transforming the camera behind/below the reflection plane and redrawing the meshes).
Since Unreal uses reverse-Z, as mentioned earlier, the pixel shader uses the min operator during downscaling.
Next follows the shadomap calculation render pass (ShadowDepths).
For stationary lights, the renderer bakes shadows for static props and calculates shadows only for dynamic (movable) props. With movable lights it calculates shadows for everything every frame (totally dynamic). Finally for static lights it bakes light+shadows into the lightmap, so they should never appear during rendering.
As the call list above corroborates, only Split0 has some geometry to render so the other tiles are empty. The shadowmap is rendered without using a pixel shader which offers double the shadowmap generation speed. Worth noting is that the ‚ÄúStationary‚Äù and ‚ÄúMovable‚Äù distinction does not hold for the Directional light it seems, the renderer renders all props (including static ones) to the shadowmap.
The single Static light does not appear at all in the drawcall list, confirming that it does not affect dynamic props only static ones through the pre-baked lightmap.
Finally a word of advice, if you have stationary lights in the scene make sure that you bake lighting before doing any profiling in the Editor (at least, I am not sure what running the game as ‚Äústandalone‚Äù does), Unreal seems to treat them as dynamic, producing cubemaps instead of using per object shadows, if not.
In the next blog post we continue the exploration of how Unreal renders a frame by looking into light grid generation, g-prepass and lighting.
Breakdown on how Unreal renders a single frame. Essential reading in my opinion.
Here‚Äôs a delightful halloween classic. Creep Night was one of the first PC games I ever got, for the first PC I ever had. I‚Äôve always liked pinball, and this is a very good PC pinball game. I also really like the little goblin mascot (I even made a wallpaper from a screenshot of him way back when. Too bad it‚Äôs long gone now).
Creep Night is a solid pinball simulation which adds things like roaming monsters and bonus games which just aren‚Äôt possible in a physical pinball machine. The layout is rather unique too. Instead of trying to emulate the long narrow shape of a conventional pinball machine, this game makes good use of the computer monitor by placing three playfields side-by-side. You get to & from these side fields via ramps, much the same way as with a pinball machine which has multiple vertical levels. The game has three stages and you can choose to play any single one, or try to defeat them all.
Creep Night is the second installment in the ‚Äú3-D Ultra Pinball‚Äù series, which has a total of five different games. The first one is just ‚Äú3-D Ultra Pinball‚Äù with no subtitle, it has a space theme. The third one is ‚ÄúThe Lost Continent‚Äù and has a dinosaur/Jurassic Park theme, it‚Äôs probably my second favorite in the series (behind Creep Night). The fourth one is ‚ÄúNASCAR‚Äù, and the theme is exactly what you‚Äôd expect. I never had the opportunity to play this one. The fith and (so far) final one is Thrill Ride. I played a demo version of this one and it was pretty good, but not as good as Creep Night nor Lost Continent. This is also the only one in the series to get a release outside the world of computers, it was also released on the Gameboy Color.

A Bob's Life: Who is on our Money?
The debate about whose face graces our money rages and I have heard some irrational and just wrong statements.
Presidents and Founding Father's have not always been and are not the only people on our money! Our money has seen generals, mythical gods and goddesses, inventors, famous people, and others.
Salmon P. Chase is on the $10,000 bill right now! Who is Salmon P. Chase and why is he on our money, even if the $10,000 is not in general circulation?
Martha Washington has been on the $1 bill twice.
Susan B. Anthony is on the $1 coin.
Sacagawea is also on $1 coins.
Mercury (yes, the Roman god) has been on dimes!
Liberty (the goddess) has been on dollar coins.
Indian likenesses have graced both pennies and nickels.
In addition, the Wright Brothers, Ceasar Rodney, Helen Keller, and John Muir have been on quarters.
On currency, 53 individuals have been depicted. You might be surprised about who they are.
Who is Running Antelope? He was once on the $5 bill.
General George H. Thomas was on the $5 during the 1890's.
It is amazing how different reality is from common perceptions!
Sinks--why did it have be a sink?
They Tell Stories . . .
Not so long ago, the idea of having a smart home only existed in the realm of science fiction. Today, home automation is quickly becoming an everyday reality the more smart devices you buy. Why limit yourself to a laptop or a smartphone, when all of the appliances you own could connect to the internet and coordinate with each other over a shared network? This is now largely possible thanks to the fast growth of the Internet of Things, which is another way of saying the internetworking of various devices. Technically, any object that is embedded with electronics can connect with other electronic objects via the Internet ‚Äì from garage doors to windows, alarm clocks, air conditioning and lighting systems.
If you buy a fridge, a washing machine or a TV in 2016, chances are you‚Äôll have the option to grab a smart version of these age-old appliances. But with each gadget you add, you also increase the vulnerability of you home network, and it can become difficult to track and monitor everything without the help of a smart home security solution that basically does all of this for you.
It is predicted that (IoT) devices will soon outnumber humans, and by 2020, the home automation industry will have exceeded $10 billion. Traditional internet security companies like Bitdefender Antivirus ‚Äì that have been developing antivirus solutions for home and business use for the past couple of decades ‚Äì are gradually shifting their attention to securing the IoT. Thanks to the rapid pace of IoT development and the ever increasing spread of smart devices, this is an entirely new challenge unlike anything we‚Äôve had to deal with before.
What is unique about it is that now cyber threats may cross the threshold from virtual to physical. Most smart devices come equipped with cameras and recording features that, in the hands of skilled hackers, can quite literally be used to spy on unsuspecting victims in their own homes. Some gadgets, such as cars, could be hacked and controlled remotely, but so could vital objects like pacemakers and insulin pumps.
Of course, any efforts made by internet security companies to rise to this occasion must be supported by legislative and regulatory changes in the near future. No one can say for sure what the interconnected world will look like in a decade or two. But what we do know now is that serious steps must be taken to ensure it remains a safe experience for everyone.

Hi, I'm In√™s Merino, a 3D Artist and Concept Artist/Illustrator working in the videogame industry.
By using the reflection of light beams, two eskimos fight for their honour. Who will win?
Nine years ago, KPCC hired a business analyst named Mark Lacter to talk about transportation here in Southern California and many, many other stories. Mark passed away last week. Tuesday morning is the time that he would have joined Steve Julian, KPCC's host of Morning Edition, to talk about some of the business stories here in Southern California that are topical and of interest to you.
This Tuesday, Julian sat down with Kevin Roderick to talk about the special reporting legacy Mark Lacter left behind.
Q: Kevin Roderick, the founder and editor of LA Observed, you worked with Mark for quite a long time?
Yes I did, Steve, although not as long as you, it turns out. He came to LA Observed in 2006, so not quite as long as he's been doing this.
Q: He had been with the L.A. Business Journal. What was it about his style, his writing, that attracted you?
Well, one thing is he was always just very clear about what he would talk about. He could take these complex economic and business issues and things like infrastructure and make them really interesting. And I thought he was the best of doing that in any business writer in Los Angeles area.
Q: He was so able to take complex stories and not dumbing them down at all, but making them accessible to everyday people.
And he absolutely loved doing that. This was a skill he brought with him from probably his newspaper days, and it was just something he really enjoyed doing. He especially liked telling stories about really complicated things that would seem boring in most people's hands, like the operations of the Port of Los Angeles or the airports. He just loved taking those and digging around and playing around with the material that's inherent in these operations and making a really compelling story out of it.
Q: One thing I noticed about his reporting with us was that, at the end of the segment, he would always have some sort of prediction: "This is not going to happen anytime soon." Did you find that coming through in his writing as well?
He did have a strong point of view, and I think that's one of the things that made him magical as a writer on the blog. Now it's also a hot button thing; that was what made him controversial to some people. He had strong opinions about things like transit in Los Angeles. ... [With public transit,] he understood it conceptually, and he liked seeing it work in other cities. He just was unconvinced that Los Angeles was the kind of place that was going to become transit-dependent or a lot of people would start riding the light rail and subways. [‚Ä¶] And he was only slowly coming around to that. ... It's just one of those areas where he was kind of opinionated.
Q: Didn't you try to handcuff him and take him onto the Green Line or something?
I told him, ... "Mark, one of these days." I've been taking the Expo Line downtown and enjoying it and riding the rails all over the city, and I was going to have to take him on. I wish we'd been able to do that.
Q: That opportunity will not come, and the hole that Mark leaves behind in his reportage, I don‚Äôt know how it gets filled in that same style, because he was just one of a kind.
Well, you know, your segments here on Tuesday mornings with him were, I think, very special moments in Los Angeles radio. You guys obviously had a very good rapport. But he was also communicating really important issues, I think, and it was a great forum for that, and he will be very much missed in this forum and all of his others.
Q: Who takes his place with you? And how do you handle that as an editor?
... He came to me in 2006 and said he would like to start writing a blog. He had never been online, and he really wanted an online forum, and it just sort of grew out of that. He took it from writing just about business to writing about city hall politics and transportation issues. And if it wasn't for him, we would probably not have a business component at the LA Observed. And I'm not sure we're going to have one going forward. It's going to be a matter of sitting down and talking to other people and seeing if there's someone else who would like to do it. But it may just be something that lived and died with Mark Lacter. Something we're unable to continue to doing, but I don't know that for sure yet, still too fresh.
A funeral service for Lacter will be held at noon Sunday, followed by a reception. More details at LA Observed.
Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated when Mark Lacter died.

I am a sculptor. My medium is junk. I work with wire, gears, bottle caps and broken bits to make things that are beautiful, or at least interesting to look at. I was not always an artist, though, and this article is not really about me. It is about the man who encouraged and nurtured my talent: George Viener.
Viener runs the Outsider Folk Art Gallery in the GoggleWorks Center for the Arts, Reading. It is called the GoggleWorks because the building used to be The Willson Safety Products and General Battery Corp. It was renovated and reopened as GoggleWorks a few years ago. The building still reflects its former use in many ways, including the old vault used as a coat room on the ground floor.
My relationship to Viener began when I visited GoggleWorks with my Grandfather. I showed my project, Cactus Jim, to Viener and he liked it a lot. Viener‚Äôs gallery is on the top floor. If you wanted to, you could just go straight up in the elevator, but then you would be missing so much. There are dozens of studios rented out by various artists, and a handful are always in. They range from self-taught builders who make things out of motors and irons, to a man on the third floor who makes landscapes out of pressed flowers. Most artists are willing to show you their creations. It is a simply delightful way to spend an afternoon.
Viener‚Äôs gallery is the largest one. His displays change quite often, as he both buys and sells pieces.
He is quite picky, and only displays work that he likes and wouldn‚Äôt mind having in his own home. The pieces he likes the most are by self-taught artists, using found materials, such as bottlecaps.

The pro-Moscow Night Wolves group has been turned away at the Polish border.
The Polish Government has declared that it will refuse entry to an extreme nationalist Russian motorcycle gang who had intended to commemorate the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany 70 years ago by riding from Moscow to Berlin. The pro-government 'Night Wolves' group, which was founded in 1989 and has a membership of approximately 5,000, has expressed their desire to recreate the Red Army's westward push during the latter stages of World War II by passing through Belarus, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria before finally reaching the German capital in triumph by 8 May.
The bikers departed from Russia on Saturday and crossed into neighbouring Belarus without issue, but Polish authorities have made it clear that they are not welcome in their territory. Border guard spokesman Dariusz Sienicki announced that "These people will not cross into Poland. Each of them will individually receive a decision denying them entry into Poland's territory." Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz went as far as to call the actions of the group a "provocation", a view which is shared by many people throughout Poland who are deeply suspicious of the actions of any organisation linked to the Russian government.
Last year, following the annexation of the Crimean peninsula, the Night Wolves made their way down to Russia's newest territory in a display of nationalistic force and solidarity. Numerous members have also proudly fought with the pro-Russian separatists in the ongoing conflict in the east of Ukraine. Additionally, Russian President Vladimir Putin himself has been photographed giving speeches to the group in the past and has even been seen riding alongside them. These factors have led to the organisation being blacklisted by the United States, a move which coincided with broader economic sanctions brought against the Russian government following the Ukraine crisis.
German authorities have also expressed their disapproval of the bikers' plan and have said that they will try to stop any attempt by the club to enter the country, even though some members already have the appropriate visas to visit Germany. "We deeply treasure freedom of speech and freedom of assembly in Germany, but we've decided that some of the leaders in the Night Wolves are not pursuing legitimate aims with these plans." said foreign ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer. He then pointed to the group's support for Crimea's annexation as concrete proof of these non-legitimate aims.
The Night Wolves themselves remain undeterred by these hindrances, with their leader Alexander Zaldostanov remaining resolute in his desire to carry out the group's goal. The publicity gained from their trip thus far has ensured that the presence of Russian nationalism is being felt within the heart of Europe.
Following the application of the legislative decree of 8 June 2001, n. 231, which introduced for the first time the concept of "administrative responsibility" for companies, Mediaset, in line with its pursuit of a style of management based on efficiency, transparency and loyalty, in all aspects of its day-to-day operations, has updated its organisational, management and control Model in line with the new regulations.
Moreover, also in the light of subsequent legislative innovations and the consequent extension of the concept of "presumed felonies", as well as ongoing jurisprudential adjustments, Mediaset and subsidiaries have made appropriate updates to such Models.
The updating process was carried out in conformity with the content of legislative decree 231/01, the guidelines drawn up by Confindustria as well as specific measures already implemented by the Mediaset Group concerning both internal control and corporate governance.
The Organisational, Management and Control Model pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001 was approved by the board of directors of Mediaset SpA by resolution on 29 July 2003 and subsequently integrated by resolutions on 18 December 2003. 7 November 2006 and 16 December 2008.
On 16th December 2008 the board of directors of Mediaset updated the document.
Independent update initiatives, relating to the company's characteristic business as well as specific sectors of operations, have also been taken by the Italian subsidiaries of Mediaset.
The version published here was adopted by resolution by the board of directors of Mediaset SpA on February 2015, following a process of analysis of the new examples of felony most recently included and recent orientations in jurisprudence and ongoing verification of the functionality and effectiveness of the Organisational Model over time and any opportune updates.

If you will connect with family members or friends on social websites, you will be able to use this for your own benefit when trying to raise some money for charity. In most cases, you will be able to use this type of websites to ask various individuals to make donations to your own cause, mostly in situations such as runs or walks where you have to find sponsors. There are websites you may use to reach out individuals who may be interested in your cause and who you might not know them personally. Every penny will add up, even if they will donate a single dollar.
1. Start by setting up your donation website through the organization you work with. Fill all the info, so anyone who may be interested will have all the details. This will also mean sharing why your cause is so important, and what you will be doing with the money. You should explain how people may donate money as well. Among the best possible ways is to accept money through online processing systems.
2. You should post the link on Facebook or any other social site. Post the link on your profile page, and then add a specific message where you can ask people if they would be interested in donating money. Offer details what the actual event will be about and what the specific cause is. Ask all of your friends on Facebook to share the link with their own friends. Facebook will enable a feature by a single click of a ‚ÄúShare‚Äù button. You may send your link as an event where you can ask people to check out your charity web page as well.
3. If you already have a Twitter social account, you can also send the link to your friends there. You can post at the end of your message or link the ‚ÄúPlease RT‚Äù expression, so they may share your link with their own followers. Another great way to reach out to various people interested in donations will be to look for a few keywords or phrases which are related to your own cause. For instance, if you are doing a walk or run for, let`s say, diabetes, you should search ‚Äúdiabetes‚Äù and then send your link as an @ reply to everyone that you find talking about this disease. Most people will make even a small donation if they are really interested in this issue.

At the beginning of every summer, it's a process to get it season-ready, though. Between cleaning up leaves, weeding, trimming the bushes. and spreading what seems like a million bags of mulch (ok closer to 30), I always spend more of my free time doing yard work in June than I ever anticipate. Luckily once the bulk of work is done, the daily and weekly maintenance is a breeze for the rest of the summer and we get to sit back, relax, and enjoy our little yard.
Prior to it's yearly taming each spring, the yard starts getting a little wild and with it's minuscule size, a little wild feels a lot wild.
In my minuscule yard, we also have a minuscule shed that needs to hold a snow blower, manual lawn mower, all of my shovels, rakes, and outside tools, and now a stroller. For me, not only is having the right tool to get the job done important, but the more compact the better...... cordless is a plus, multipurpose tools is a huge plus, easy to store is a massive plus. To help with this year's taming of the yard, Toro kindly sent me a couple Toro PowerPlex‚Ñ¢ 40V Max* Lithium Ion Products to try.
I first set out on the front yard with the Toro PowerPlex‚Ñ¢ 13 inch string trimmer/edger on the front yard. All 170sf of it. We use a manual mower that came with the house, but with each mow, we use a trimmer to get all the edges and anything the push mower missed. And the morning glories. I have a love/hate relationship with morning glories. Every year, by the end of summer, the metal fence is covered with beautiful morning glories (yay!) but they grow like weeds and will try to take over my lawn, garden, and anywhere possible (boo!)- string trimmer to the rescue!
This handy little trimmer has an extra long battery life (up to 45 min!) which was an issue we had with our previous trimmer. It can also easily rotate to be used as an edger with a guide and wheel. Multi-purpose tool? Sold!
They work great for small tasks, but trimming larger bushes... say a 12+ foot tall burning bush... is pretty much impossible with it. Toro PowerPlex‚Ñ¢ 24 inch hedge trimmer to the rescue! Please excuse the stank-face...I was glaring at the sun, not the trimmer.
I'm loving that it's cordless. In years past I've tried borrowing my dad's corded trimmer for the task, and this trimmer is so much easier to navigate than a corded one that you're constantly afraid of cutting the cord. It also feels so much safer since you need to have both hands on the trimmer or it will automatically turn off.
When at long last (or so it seems) the yard is finally tamed for the season, I get to take a deep breath, pull out my folding hammock, and enjoy the space all summer with minimal maintenance.
Thanks Toro PowerPlex‚Ñ¢ 40V Max* Lithium Ion Products for helping me get my yard summer-ready!
Dahlias, in my personal opinion, are pretty much the best flower out there. There may even have been a consideration that a late summer wedding would allow me to have dahlias in my bouquet. We got married late July and yes, dahlias were a required attendant. This year, I finally decided to muster up the guts and grow some dahlias myself. I'm not talking about the bitsy little potted dahlias you can pick up in the annuals section of the plant store either. I'm talking about buying tubers (the bulb-like roots) and growing dahlias literally from the ground up.
I'm so pleased to say that it is now Dahlia season and I've had some marginal success growing these gorgeous blooms. Mom grew them for the first time this year too, so we learned what to do (and what not to do) together. AND now I'm here to share them with you.
Watering isn't necessary until the tubers decide to pop their little green sprouts above the surface of the soil. If you overwater before they've popped, the tubers could rot. I learned this the hard way. I planted 18 tubers, and only 11 grew. Once they start growing, water your heart out.
Stakes are your BFFs. As soon as the plants reach a foot or 2, tie them to a stake. These seriously help them grow sky high. I staked early, Mom a bit later. Some of her plants got a little squirly at the base and didn't straighten out once they were staked. Mine on the other hand? Even though the tubers claimed 36"-48" tall, several of these guys are reaching well above the top of my 5'-6" head.
Aside from liking stakes, the flowers like being cut. The more blooms you cut, the more they produce. How sweet is that? It's like they're MADE to fill up vases throughout my house. Keep 'em coming!
Speaking of cutting them... As tempting as it is to cut off a bloom as soon as it opens up, resist! Older blooms will last much longer when cut. Once you do cut them, though, place them directly into super hot water (not boiling) and then change the water every couple days to maximize their longevity.
I'm beyond the moon about how gorgeous these plants ended up this year! My only challenge left will be to dig them up before the first frost and preserve the tubers to reuse next year.
What Dahlia growing tips would you add to this list??
This is one of those years where summer seems to be wizzing past even though it's just started. Where has it gone already?! I'm totally behind with our gardens and haven't even finished mulching the veggie garden. I feel like this should get finished before July hits.... tomorrow... we'll see what kind of motivation I come home from Grover with tonight. Nothing has changed drastically in my back yard/garden in the past year, but I like to share it here each year anyway- it's like my little garden year book.
It's going to be positively paradise once the hydrangea start blooming. It's my little suburban sanctuary. When everything is in full bloom late summer, and I've hopefully finished mulching, I'll give you the full 2014 yarden (yard/garden) tour- which will probably look very similar to 2013's. Between the front, back, and sides of the house, our yard takes 30 bags of mulch and only has 170sf of grass. Definitely skewed a bit, but I'd rather play in gardens then mow a huge lawn any day.
The newest addition to our yard is a monstrous rain barrel. I convinced Hubby that we needed one for when our town institutes a water ban (usually during a long hot spell in the summer) and we still need to water the veggies. When I tried to put the barrel directly under the water spout as I originally intended, however, it looked gargantuan and beyond ridiculous. I settled on hiding it in a corner, but now have to deal with re-routing the downspout.
Although I ventured to Home Depot for all the parts (which I did get), I got distracted by picking out plants for Grover and subsequently spent my afternoon playing in the dirt at the flip instead of installing my own rain barrel. I have a feeling this will be the story of my life for the next couple weeks. We are T minus 14 days before we hope to list Grover, the latest fliphouse. One-track mind may not even begin to cover it. I'll do my best not to talk exclusively flip here. I wouldn't want to bore you with daily updates of what trim I painted or what light fixture I installed. Enthralling, I know, but I'll keep it to my weekly updates.
Returning to my own abode and veering slightly off topic- guest what finally got ordered!!!!!
After 3.5 years of complaining about my over-sized budget furniture store sofa, he's getting replaced with the gorgeous Diane from Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams! She's certainly a splurge and will be the most we've spent on any piece of furniture ever.... but I intend on having this pretty lady around for a very long time. Now I only have to wait about 8 weeks for her to come in (sadface). Oh well, at least she's ordered!!! Can you tell I'm excited?
I'll be daydreaming of my new velvetty sofa whilst I manage to cover myself with dirt, mulch, and paint over at Grover. Happy Monday all!
The TaylorMade Spider putters are changing the game again with the Spider Interactive models. These are the same modern mallets made with a multi-material constitution for high MOI, maximum stability, and better roll. Now they include a BLAST Motion Sensor embedded in the grip that captures all your putting data and syncs with the mobile app to help you analyze, practice, and improve. The sensor is removable as well so it's Tournament-legal when you need it. A lightweight aluminum core is paired with a heavy stainless steel frame for a high resistance to twisting, keeping the face square to the path. The Pure Roll insert is angled at 45¬∞ to increase forward roll and improve distance control. This design features a single alignment line to improve aim.
How best determine best length, 33, 34, 35 in?
As a guideline for standard lengths, If you're 6 feet or taller, use a 35&quot; putter is recommended, if you're 5'9 inches to 5'11 tall, a 34-inch putter. Golfers who are 5'5 to 5'8 use a 33 putter. Be advised this is just a guideline. For bit fit we would recommend being fitted with a local golf shop or professional.
"The difference between a need and a claim is a clear-cut one. Nevertheless, if the psychic undercurrents have changed the one into the other, the neurotic is not only unaware of the difference but is indeed averse to seeing it. He speaks of an understandable or natural wish when he really means a claim; and he feels entitled to many things which a bit of clear thinking could show him are not inevitably his. I am thinking, for instance, of some patients who are furiously indignant when they get a ticket for double parking. Once again, the wish to "get by" is completely understandable, but they are not entitled to exemption. It is not that they do not know the laws. But they argue (if they think about it at all) that others get by, and that it is therefore unfair that they should have been caught.
"For these reasons it seems advisable to speak simply of irrational or neurotic claims. They are neurotic needs which individuals have unwittingly turned into claims. And they are irrational because they assume a right, a title, which in reality does not exist. In other words, they are excessive by the very fact of being made as claims instead of being recognized simply as neurotic needs. The special content of the claims that are harbored varies in detail, according to the particular neurotic structure. Generally speaking, however, the patient feels entitled to everything that is important to him--to the fulfillment of his particular neurotic needs."

One of the most basic problems with the ongoing improvements in gaming console technology is the issue of backwards compatibility. In the past, games from its predecessor would not be compatible with the latest version of the game console. Xbox360 games have this feature. There are ways so that you can play your Xbox games using the 360 console.
One way of allowing you to play both versions of the said games is via updating your game console through the Live system. However, it is required in this method that a broadband internet connection is present. The simple process of connecting your game unit to an available broadband connection will allow you to update your system.
After connecting, all that you really have to do is to wait for the process to finish. Afterwards, you can start playing your original Xbox360 games! By doing this, you remain updated about the latest addition to the games that are being supported by the system. Of course you would be needing a Live account, which could either be a Silver or the Gold membership package.
Another method that would to allow you to play Xbox games on your 360 console is by CD or DVD burning. This is for those who do not have a broadband internet connection. A simple dial-up connection would be sufficient for the download to complete.
Using this method, one could simply go to http://Xbox.com and download a copy of the game and simply burn it on a disc. This is especially useful for people whose consoles are not connected to a broadband internet connection. It also adds that you could get a supported copy of the game some place else, where an internet connection and a CD or DVD burner is present. This saves you from the task of having to bring the whole game console just to get the supported games. The process is just as simple as creating an audio cd. This should not prove to be that difficult even for beginners.
The last of the methods which would allow gamers to play Xbox360 games in a 360 console would be to order it directly from http://Xbox.com. However, this method would only be available by Early December to some people. But then again, it may seem as the most viable option. The disc includes all the necessary updates needed by the system to enable it to have backwards compatibility. It will be updating the program for the backwards compatibility, which would of course also update the operating system for your game console.
I should say that this backwards compatibility feature is really ingenious. First of all, it saves gamers all that money that would either go to waste. Waste of money happens because they cannot use their old games or they purchase new games. Although this feature only allows your Xbox360 and Xbox games to be played on the 360 console, it will definitely be a feature that would dictate future technological developments in the gaming industry.

Q: All of your arguments with signings like Shannon Brown are followed by "if" Dwyane Wade is healthy or "if" Danny Granger is back. I agree with that. However, this team should not be going forward like this. It's too risky. We need a better backup for Wade and the need at point guard has not been addressed, which was a glaring deficiency in the Finals. I know Pat Riley is not done, and as much as I hope D.W. is healthy, it makes no sense to risk the season on "ifs." -- Chet.
A: "Ifs" are what every team that's not the favorite carry into the season. I'm sure last year at this time the concerns in San Antonio included "if" the Spurs aren't too old, the caution in Oklahoma City was "if" Russell Westbrook could stay healthy, the worry in Chicago was "if" Derrick Rose could last an entire season. As for point guard, the worry a year ago was "if" Mario Chalmers and Norris Cole were good enough to get the Heat back to the Finals.
Q: Face it, to this point Pat Riley has done a very questionable job in putting together a bench that makes sense. You know better. Let's hope James Ennis or somebody unexpected will emerge. -- Matt.
A: All teams have flaws. What I know is that with Chris Bosh and Josh McRoberts, this team is better set 1-2 in the power rotation than it has been in years. And Shabazz Napier has a winning pedigree, so don't sell him short in the backcourt rotation. Perhaps he's your "bonus" addition. And there still are names and time out there. For every Leandro Barbosa that has come off the board, there still is a Jordan Crawford. And there also will be plenty of buyout names as camps draw closer, Jason Richardson potentially among them.
Q: I think what is frustrating for Miami Heat fans is that in some weird way it feels as though the last four years didn't exist. It is as though they have been erased from NBA memory. Does that make sense? Of course they haven't, and we have great memories. But LeBron James is gone and he was such a big part of the team. LeBron became an NBA champion with the Heat, attacked all the way through, and now back with Cleveland he is loved! Instead of the media writing about will the Heat make a record fifth consecutive trip to the NBA Finals (and this is how the 2014-2015 team compares to the prior years' teams.), we are still in a bit of a daze even though we understand why LeBron left. -- Stuart.
A: My response to that would be that even when the Heat won titles, Erik Spoelstra would say on the opening day of camp that it is time to move on, that you have to close the book on the previous season. There also is the reality that this is not the same team. If LeBron would have left and if Luol Deng was the only change, then with Shane Battier, Ray Allen, Rashard Lewis and others, it would have had the feel of somewhat of the same team. But there has been a significant overhaul. This is not your 2013-14 Heat or the roster that made four consecutive NBA Finals. Pat Riley has moved on. So, apparently, has the NBA. What matters is embracing what is next.

There are five major categories of brain waves, each corresponding to different activities. Meditation enables us to move from higher frequency brain waves to lower frequency, which activates different centers in the brain.
As yogis have known for centuries and scientists can now prove, the benefits of meditation are profound.
Meditation is perhaps the most crucial instrument to harness the power of thought, cultivate more peace, clarity and happiness.
Learning to train the brain and focus our attention is crucial to thriving and cultivating a peak performance in any endeavor.
Long-time psychotherapist Dr. Ron Alexander, author of Wise Mind, Open Mind, speaks of MIND STRENGTH, or the resiliency, efficacy and emotional intelligence that arise as we begin the process of controlling the mind. Mind strength is one of the most empowering tools we can employ to impact and improve all aspects of life.
Slower wavelengths = more time between thoughts = more opportunity to skillfully choose which thoughts you invest in and what actions you take.
1. Gamma State: (30 - 100Hz) This is the state of hyperactivity and active learning. Gamma state is the most opportune time to retain information. This is why educators often have audiences jumping up and down or dancing around -- to increase the likelihood of permanent assimilation of information. If over stimulated, it can lead to anxiety.
2. Beta State: (13 - 30Hz) Where we function for most of the day, beta state is associated with the alert mind state of the prefrontal cortex. This is a state of the "working" or "thinking mind" -- analytical, planning, assessing and categorizing.
3. Alpha State: (9 - 13Hz) Brain waves start to slow down out of thinking mind. We feel more calm, peaceful and grounded. We often find ourselves in an "alpha state" after a yoga class, a walk in the woods, a pleasurable sexual encounter or during any activity that helps relax the body and mind. We are lucid, reflective, have a slightly diffused awareness. The hemispheres of the brain are more balanced (neural integration).
4. Theta State: (4 - 8Hz) We are able to begin meditation. This is the point where the verbal/thinking mind transitions to the meditative/visual mind. We begin to move from the planning mind to a deeper state of awareness (often felt as drowsy), with stronger intuition, more capacity for wholeness and complicated problem solving. The theta state is associated visualization.
A simple meditation to use to begin the transition from Beta or Alpha to the Theta State is to focus on the breath. The breath and mind work in tandem, so as breath begins to lengthen, brain waves begin to slow down.
To begin the meditation, sit comfortably in your chair with your shoulders relaxed and spine tall. Place your hands mindfully on your lap, close your eyes and as much as possible eliminate any stimulus that may distract you.
Watch your breath. Simply notice your breath flowing in. Flowing out. Don't try to change it in any way. Just notice.
Silently repeat the mantra: "Breathing In. Breathing Out." As your mind begins to wander, draw it back to your breath. Notice that as your breath begins to lengthen and fill your body, your mind begins to calm.
Consistency is key. Try to do this breath meditation first thing in the morning and/or at night. Be consistent with your meditation. Shorter meditations on a regular basis are more productive than long sessions every few weeks. Aim for 5 minutes a day and add 1 minutes each week.

Re: Xbox One disconnecting. Wired connection. All other devices still connected.
Apologies for the connection issues you're experiencing, I appreciate it's frustrating. I know you've probably been through all the basics, but for us to progress with our diagnostics please confirm the following.
- Do you experience connection issues on multiple devices?
- Does Modem Mode change the performance?
- Does the time of day make any difference?
- Do all consoles on your network have difficulties?
If you get back to us we will do our very best to help.
No, it happens in router mode and modem mode just the same. I am actually running modem mode all the time with a Netduma R1 router.
Not just consoles but anything connected to the internet via ethernet has this problem. My wife never gets it with her laptop because she always uses wifi.
Same here, I have lost 50 followers on twitch over the past week from constant dropouts!
I've taken a good look at your network and the only thing I'm picking us is that your upstream power levels are slightly on the high side right now, but could be fluctuating. I'd be happy to arrange for an engineer to call around to investigate. I'll get in touch with you via PM (purple envelope, top right) to discuss this further.
It's been a few days since we spoke last so I just wanted to pop by and see how you're getting on.
Hello I'm having the exact same issue but every time I call support they tell me my connection is fine from the speed tests. I couldn't be anymore frustrated than I am now from going around in circles. I know the basics, I have done all the troubleshooting and now I have to put up with this farce. Could you please for the love of gaming tell me what's wrong? It's quite a coincidence that this happens to so many people within this time frame.
I have experienced this issue also.
This is nothing to do with your Broadband or outside network. - NO point in VM testing your broadband!
It is purely down to the Network/internal ports of the Superhub 3. If it was broadband related connections would not work on wifi, when it drops on your ethernet connected devices.
I've got the same issue everyone in this thread is facing. The only option is just to switch ISP. Lucky me! my contract has just expired. But even if the contract was still running, it's not valid as I can easily proof that VM is not delivering the service I subscribed for.
I'm experiencing this exact same issue but with the SH5. I have a SH5 downstairs and have an ethernet cable routed to one of our rooms upstairs which plugs into a Belkin mini ethernet switch (5 port). My xbox and laptop then plug into this mini switch as well. I will be pinging my router and xbox from my laptop whilst plugged in with no issue then i'll have a drop out for about 5/6 packets from my Xbox before the connection picks up again. My laptop stays connected as normal but just the Xbox which drops out. So annoying, never had this issue when living at mum and dads with BT. I've also plugged directly into the router with my Xbox and same issue again.
Taken my Xbox to a friends house not using Virgin and plugged in and no dropouts again. Tried different and known working cables at every step but no change. Had Virgin out to test connection but showing no issues. I am most likely to be changing ISP unless someone comes out and tries to swap out my SH5.
Massively poor up time with internet as well, always having issues in our area, working from home in IT as well which makes this all the more difficult.
$780.00 - plus dana (offered at the end of the retreat) to Heartwood. You can read more about the practice of dana here.
Fasting for spiritual and health purposes is widely practiced all over the world, and is still a part of every major religion in the world. Jesus, Buddha, Muhammed and Baha‚Äôu‚Äôllah all shared a common belief in the helpful and productive power of fasting.
We at Heartwood Refuge and Retreat Center know water fasting can be an excellent protocol for rejuvenating body, mind and spirit and want to support you as a destination as you undertake your self-directed water fast with the full support of therapies and practitioners who not only understand the science, but actually fast, themselves.
Fasting has been shown to help people recover from mild to severe health conditions. Some of the most common ones are high blood pressure, asthma, allergies, chronic headaches, inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn‚Äôs disease), irritable bowel syndrome, adult onset diabetes, heart disease, degenerative arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, eczema, acne, uterine fibroids, benign tumors, and systemic lupus erythematosus.
Fasting is a time when the body can devote itself to healing, repairing and strengthening damaged organs eliminating accumulated toxins and waste products. The body is very intelligent. When we fast, the body starts ‚Äúburning‚Äù the trash first‚Ä¶the damaged cells, tumors, waste products, etc.
This is a time when the digestive tract time can completely rest and strengthen its mucosal lining. A healthy mucosal lining is a crucial to the health of the body in general and a preventive or healer of Leaky Gut Syndrome. That is the leakage of incompletely digested proteins into the bloodstream, which are at the root of most autoimmune conditions and food allergies.

Bonnie checked the gauge. Red.
She slowed to thirty. The headlights flashed a pump beside the elevators. Bonnie pulled in and got out. She crossed the street and knocked at a house. A light blossomed, and a man opened the door.
He returned with keys and opened the co-op. He filled Bonnie‚Äôs tank and cleaned her windshield. She offered fifty.
The Meta-Story: This version is 99 words. To get it that short, I altered the true story. For a more accurate version of what happened that night in 1972, read below. I was the eight-year-old daughter. My mom‚Äôs nickname is Bennie. I made her Bonnie for clarity. We were accompanied by my little sister, but it cluttered my story unnecessarily, and I doubt she remembers that night Mom was scared we‚Äôd run out of gas on the highway. In those days, there were no mobile phones, no 24/7 Quik Trips in Copeland. You relied on your neighbors and the kindness of strangers. Like Mom did one summer around midnight.
For the last fifty miles, the headlights revealed nothing but broken, yellow line. Bonnie checked the gas gauge. In the red. Her eight-year-old daughter, Mindy, read the first sign they‚Äôd seen for an hour.
Bonnie slowed from sixty to thirty through the darkened town.
‚ÄúFive more hours.‚Äù The headlights flashed a gas pump beside the grain elevators. Bonnie pulled in and got out. She crossed the street and knocked at the nearest house. A light came on, and an old man opened the door.
He returned with a set of keys. Bonnie followed him back to the co-op, where he opened up and switched on the pump. He filled Bonnie‚Äôs tank, cleaned her windshield, and gave Mindy a jawbreaker from a jar inside on the counter.
Bonnie offered him a fifty on top of the gas. He refused.
‚ÄúYou two get home safe now,‚Äù he said.
I don‚Äôt know why, but when I first opened the story I was half-expecting a tale about Pansy. I must miss her.
This was a great story, and I enjoyed the explanation and the longer version. I once coasted into a small town on fumes to find their gas station had closed the month before, and the nearest town was still half an hour away. Luckily, I met someone in the diner there who had a few five gallon gas cans on hand and he gave me enough fuel to get to the next town.
I read the second version one more time, and that Cecil character certainly sounds like a kind man. I hope you have a wonderful day, Kecia. I think you just lifted my spirits this morning with this story.
Mandie, your story would be perfect for this prompt of the diner.
Pansy and everything else but flash for the blog and a couple of contests are on a back burner while I crunch and mash the structure of a novel. I have one more scene to write for what I hope is the last, large-scale change I want. I wrote three of the four yesterday. I was so proud of myself. Grind, grind, grind.
Thank you for reading. I enjoy your comments.
Haha I‚Äôm pretty sure the whole town was in that diner, and everyone stopped and looked at me when I walked in.
That is so awesome, Kecia. It sounds like you accomplished so much yesterday. I can‚Äôt say the same for myself. If it wasn‚Äôt for meeting with my writing group yesterday, I‚Äôd probably have nothing to account for my time.
I do remember those cases when time did not matter‚Ä¶ I think that you can still get help sometimes, though today there are credit cards‚Ä¶ somehow it‚Äôs easier, but less opportunity to meet and be met with compassion.
I have faint memories of pulling up to a farm tank in the dead of night. Mom stole a tank of gas, she did things like that. The farmer shot at us from the porch, but mom stepped on the pedal and we threw dirt clouds behind us. I was about 7-8 at the time and thought it was cool, like the ‚ÄòDuke of Hazard‚Äô and the ‚ÄòGeneral Lee‚Äô. That same farmer was later one of my foster dads, and he never let me forget what mom had done.
Memories are made of events like this, I enjoyed the second more detailed story also.
I was waiting for it to all go wrong. What a refreshing tale of kindness. Nice one.
No murders this time. I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed it. Thanks for reading.
Very much a different time. It was more the norm then for people to help. People do still help but just less frequently.
True. Thank you for commenting.
Bless his heart. Salt of the earth.
Many people like that still live in Kansas. Thank you for reading.
This was such an uplifting bit of nostalgia. Of such stuff are memories built. Well done, Kecia. I have always enjoyed your writings.
This is lovely. I really like both the longer and the shorter version. The only thing that I think is lost and I was confused about in the short version is that it reads like the man wouldn‚Äôt take any money, and I wasn‚Äôt sure about that. Still, really nice writing.
Thank you for reading. Welcome to my blog, Claire.
Lucky that petrol station was there and that the chap came out to help. I bet no-one would nowadays.
There are still a lot of Kansans who would help. Cecils and Margarets and their kids and their grandkids.
I love the story, Kecia. I live in a small community and one of the storekeepers was much like Cecil. Today, it‚Äôs all so impersonalble, but at least you can buy gas with a credit card in the middle of the night without having to wake anyone up.
I think we planned more for our outings and stayed home more. We didn‚Äôt hop up at 11pm on a milk run. We waited until the store opened the next morning. But my mom was a do-er and a go-er, and we were coming home from a horse show. (My older sister was a serious competitor.) My mom was also extremely self-sufficient, and that one time she was low on gas, she got us out of the trouble. Nothing slowed her down.
people were much more self-sufficient in that era. You had to be. We lived in the country and my parents only went to town once a week. If you forgot something, you had to wait a whole week before the next run.
Yes, Christine. I remember Dad waiting until after 7 to call his parents in Ohio. We all had to gather in the living room for our turn to talk. He kept an eye on the time so we didn‚Äôt run up the phone bill. Imagine that!
Exactly, Russ. Yet there was always something to eat. I remember my dad kept powdered milk in the case that we ran out before he could get to the store for more. He hated not having milk for his cereal in the morning!
I saw the name and thought of Bonnie and Clyde. Your story was an anticlimax!
I thought of them, too. I also thought of Holcomb, KS. This story could have very quickly gone bad. It was actually in the back of my mind as a contrast to what really happened. One expects something terrible to happen to a lone woman and her daughter on a lonely highway in the middle of the night. But, nope, there are decent people out there, too.
Thank you for reading, and welcome to my blog.
Its always good to read good stuff. Reality of life is horrifying that its pleasant to read nice things!
I agree with Iain. A tale of kindness is often needed and you delivered it!
Such a nice story. There are still good ones out there, I am sure. We have just become too scared to even ask.
Lovely story, I could picture the grain elevators and the dark pumps. I liked that the prompt took you to a simpler time and place.
I enjoy your writing style. It paints a vivid picture in the reader‚Äôs mind, even with only 99 words to work with.
Thank you. That‚Äôs a very nice compliment. Welcome to my blog.
Both of them were well-written, even the shorter one to fit the category.
Thank you. That‚Äôs kind of you to say. Welcome to the blog.

The Postgraduate Event Management course I undertook at The Fitzwilliam Institute has not only been very enjoyable and exciting, it has provided me with the perfect platform to branch out into the world of event management. I received great assistance with sourcing my work placement. Over the 12 week period, I had the opportunity to plan events for a number of blue chip corporate companies and designed their events from start to finish. I gained invaluable hands on experience working on a wide variety of events. Both the course and the practical experience gained during my work placement have reinforced my choice of career in event management.
1.) It was a good fit for me. This programme was well suited to me as a mature student, looking to return to the workplace after a five year break. It was informative, relevant, challenging and thoroughly enjoyable.
2.) It was a great learning experience - more than I expected. The course was very interactive and fast paced, with a great emphasis on practical skills - I retained what I learned by working together in peer groups on numerous practical projects. A great mix of students of different ages, experiences, backgrounds and strengths - This presented the opportunity to start building a network of event management contacts. The lecturers were all experts in their various fields and very supportive and interested in bringing out the best in each student. The lecturers drew examples from specific aspects of their work experiences, to bring their lecturers to life for us.
3.) The work experience offered as part of the programme was invaluable. Through my work experience on this course, I was able to identify that one of my strengths lies in working in logistics. My work experience took me abroad to work on and witness an event in the planning for several months unfold - A fantastic opportunity and unforgettable experience.
4.) Volunteering opportunities. We were given the opportunity to work as volunteers on a variety of charitable events from the very small lesser know ones to several very large, well known and publicised charitable events. This experience brought to life what we as students could possibly be involved with in the future.
5.) The right mix. This course had the right mix of perfect ingredients to make it the best course I have ever taken: brilliant lecturers, interested students, industry relevant information, practical projects, hands on work experience and with support throughout the entire programme from lecturers and peers.
It has been nearly a year since I finished the Postgraduate Diploma Course with Fitzwilliam Institute Group and I cannot believe how quickly it has flown by and everything I have done since then! After 3 months of work experience, when I was able to put all that I had learned in the classroom into practice, I went straight into a job working for a great sport event management company.

By , NAIROBI, August 28 ‚Äì The re-launch of the Fairmont chain of hotels that was to take place early this year has now been pushed to 2009.
The one year delay is being blamed on bottlenecks experienced in the importation of building materials, and further accelerated by the post election violence that rocked the country early this year.
Speaking to Capital Business News, Fairmont East Africa Managing Director Sean Billing said the renovation of the Fairmont Mara, Mt Kenya and Norfolk properties, which had initially experienced a one-year delay are still behind schedule.
‚ÄúClearing cargo at the port has been a nightmare resulting to increased costs due to taxes and extra transport expenses of the building materials,‚Äù Billing explained.
However, Billing said the group still intends to operate within the initial $35 million investment budget despite this hiccups.
‚ÄúWe obviously have had to make some changes in the renovation plans, but unfortunately the changes have been to try and stay within that budget. This will affect the overall quality but the renovations will still be ahead of the competition,‚Äù he said.
Out of the three hotels that were under renovation only the Fairmont Mara Safari Club refurbishment is near complete.
Meanwhile, the East African hotel chain boss is of the view that increasing bed capacity in the tourism industry may not be the solution to meeting the country‚Äôs efforts of fully exploit the industry.
Billing is of the opinion that until the sector is able to achieve steady bed occupancy through the year, there is really no need for new investments.
He observed that the sector needs to emphasise on improving product quality, which he feels is still low compared to Kenya‚Äôs competitors in the industry.
‚ÄúThis country has one of the most diverse products in the world ranging from beach, cultural, mountaineering, and eco tourism among others,‚Äù Billing stressed.
Though still optimistic that the entry of the chain into the country was not a mistake, Billing revealed that their revenues had gone down by almost 50 percent after the violence that rocked the country earlier in the year.
‚ÄúFor us when we combine the unrest plus the delays to construction which meant that we do not have full inventories, we don‚Äôt have our full spaces, then we are talking about our revenues being cut by half,‚Äù he stated.
During the last three years prior to the post poll skirmishes, the Kenya Tourism Board had been citing investment in increased bed capacity as the biggest challenge to growing the industry.

We are at a Catskill resort to celebrate my parents‚Äô 50th anniversary. Even in its heyday, the Homowack would not have been up to my family‚Äôs standards. It‚Äôs not that it wasn‚Äôt fancy enough‚Äîmy parents gravitated toward rustic North Carolina lodges. It just attracted a different type of guest, those from Brooklyn or the Bronx, where most patrons are more religiously observant and perhaps less refined than those of us who hail originally from Atlanta and Seattle. But we sought a place with kosher food near my parents‚Äô New York and New Jersey children and grandchildren.
When I asked in advance about wheelchair accessibility, I heard with my ears the answer that Mother will have to use the entrance near the kitchen. With my ears, not with my brain. I picture my kitchen door, and that doesn‚Äôt seem so bad. Arriving a bit ahead of my folks, my husband Julian and I check out the back entrance. I am horrified that my 78-year-old mother, the guest of honor, will enter through a swarm of flies buzzing about the garbage cans. How can I be subjecting my mother to this indignity? She finds her limitations indignity enough.
At Friday night services, I discover that the featured guest is the evangelical Rebbetzin (Rabbi‚Äôs wife) Jungreis. Oh boy, I think, as I look around at my genteel Reform cousin who looks like a swami in her impromptu head covering. I fear that the Rebbetzin‚Äôs fervor will overwhelm my family, who take their Judaism in small, manageable doses.
The next afternoon, Aunt Jo, whose beliefs are as fiery as ever, even though age ‚Äì84 ‚Äì has toned her flaming hair down to a dusty red, complains. ‚ÄúThey must know I‚Äôm a Reform Jew. No one says ‚Äòhello‚Äô when they pass me in the hall.‚Äù I gently explain that most guests are New Yorkers, who lack the southerner‚Äôs innate friendliness. My ‚Äúnothing personal‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem to reassure her.
Julian and I suggest a picnic at a state park for the geriatric members of our group: my parents, my three aunts, Mom‚Äôs nurse, and my aunts‚Äô three traveling companions. First stop is the resort kitchen to get sandwiches made to order: this without mustard, that without mayonnaise, another with no onion or garlic. I drive my little car and Julian steers my sister‚Äôs station wagon, leaving her and her husband behind to care for our respective children.
As we go up the mountain, I hear something scrape the ground under the car. I stop, climb down from the driver‚Äôs seat, and peer under the car. No branch that I can see. We continue, and the scraping continues. I climb down, peer, nothing appears. We drive a little further, more scraping, another stop. This time we all climb down and look. There seems to be more space between the floor and the road with the load lightened. Darn, I hope I don‚Äôt pop my springs. Too bad I have two extra-large people in the back seat of my little Dodge Aries on this steep road. I load my weighty passengers back into the car. Please, no disasters. I can‚Äôt imagine where the closest repair shop is.
‚ÄúB.J., darling, I need a bathroom stop. Can you find a place?‚Äù Aunt Emilie‚Äôs voice sounds more desperate than her words.
At a crossroads, I pull up in front of a restaurant with a sign, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not planning to eat here, don‚Äôt even ask about using our facilities.‚Äù I park anyway, and with Aunt Emilie accompanying me in baby steps, cross the highway to another eating establishment. This one claims no public facilities. We creep back to the car, then drive across the other way. This time I ask Aunt Emilie to wait in the car while I negotiate. I know I‚Äôm going to have to say things that will embarrass her, and I prefer that she not be listening in.
I convince the deli servers to let my aunt use the employees‚Äô facilities, a third-world embarrassment to the clean, first-world, New York State in which we supposedly travel. And I worried about what I‚Äôd have to say? Phew!
Mission accomplished, we continue to scrape our way up the mountainside to the state park. Now it‚Äôs Mom‚Äôs turn to use the facilities, a large, rustic, handicapped-accessible rest room with a toilet on one side and a sturdy hand rail five feet away from the toilet. It‚Äôs fortunate that Mom‚Äôs nurse and I are there to help.
At last we head down the paved path to lakeside picnic tables set among tall hardwoods. Mom‚Äôs smile while her nurse pushes her along the pavement among the trees displays her pleasure at the view of the lake. Julian and I move the canoe from car top to water, And I help my beaming Aunt Jo climb in. ‚ÄúShe sailed away on a bright and sunny day,‚Äù flits through my head as Julian pulls away from shore. They paddle back and forth, Aunt Jo mostly resting, Julian doing the work.
Are we having fun yet? Are we having fun at all? Why is this family group, who know and love each other, so serious, almost morose looking? Are the picnic benches too uncomfortable, the picnic food not fine enough?
And yet, at the end of the day, they rave to the stay-behinds about their good time. The final day, they all proclaim the picnic in the Catskills to be the highlight, after the anniversary party itself. I will never again hear the phrase, ‚ÄúAre we having fun yet?‚Äù without picturing the dour faces and grim expressions of my aunts and their travel companions on one sunny afternoon in the Catskill Mountains.
We had an almost identical experience for my father-in-law‚Äôs 90th birthday (I‚Äôll bet Dan & Ilana will remember it). It was also at the Homowack (and I did go to the Catskill resorts in their heyday) but that was not their heyday. The place smelled moldy, the food was classic heavy Jewish lumps of kugel, etc., and in general the place left everything to be desired. Yet I now remember fondly getting together with all the family to celebrate his birthday and of course the photo is priceless. Moral of the story? It‚Äôs the people, not the food or surroundings, that counts.

Despite semi-final loss, Para Team's future remains bright.
Canada Soccer‚Äôs Para Soccer Team will play a pair of international matches this week as part of the Tri-Nation Invitational Challenge hosted by the US Soccer Federation. The three-match series will feature USA v Australia on 19 July, Canada v Australia on 20 July, and Canada v host USA on 21 July.
Canada‚Äôs two international matches will provide an important development step ahead of the 2018 IFCPF Americas Championships in Natal, Brazil. It also marks Canada‚Äôs first international matches since the IFCPF adjusted the player eligibility rules for Para Soccer earlier this year.
The 2018 IFCPF Americas Championships runs 12 to 21 October in Natal. Two stadia will be used for the competition, the Maria lamas Farache Stadium and the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte.
Canada Para Soccer will face Brazil, Republic of Ireland, and Spain at this year‚Äôs IFCPF World Championships in San Luis, Argentina. The 16-nation competition kicks off this 10 September, with Canada looking to again crack the top-10 in the world.
Fans can follow the IFCPF World Championships across Canada Soccer‚Äôs digital channels from 10-23 September. Canada‚Äôs three group matches are 10 September against Brazil, 12 September against Republic of Ireland, and 14 September against Spain. Canada will then play three more matches from 18 to 23 September to determine their world ranking.
Coach Ferguson has arguably some of the best young players in the world, including 19-year old Samuel Charron and 20-year Liam Stanley. Canada‚Äôs 14-man squad also features the program‚Äôs most experienced player Dustin Hodgson and 50-year young midfielder Jamie Ackinclose. Both Hodgson and Ackinclose rank with Charron among the program‚Äôs all-time top-five goalscorers.
From the last IFCPF World Championships in 2015, Canada has returned five players in Charron, Hodgson, Nicholas Heffernan, Stanley, and goalkeeper Damien Wojtiw. That team finished in 10th place, the program‚Äôs second-best ranking. Ackinclose is the one other player with previous IFCPF World Championships experience, although he missed the last competition through injury.
‚ÄúWe will rely on the experience of Jamie Ackinclose to help stabilize a very young squad, but we know that players like Samuel Charron and Liam Stanley can both be our spark in speed and quality to help us reach our goals at this event,‚Äù said Ferguson.
This marks Canada‚Äôs sixth participation in the biennial IFCPF World Championship since 2005, with their best ranking a 9th place finish in 2009. Canada qualified for the 2017 IFCPF World Championships last year through the Qualification Tournament in Denmark.

Sleeping Giant is exceptional and affecting, a film both provocative and probing of the deep characteristics of these kids. Yes, there are moments that veer towards the predictable, but there's enough heart and grit in the telling that I found myself swept away anyway.
What‚Äôs particularly admirable here is the way the cast and filmmakers illuminate not just the wit and charm of young men, but also the callow cruelty of youth, driven by a killer combination of na√Øve idealism, solipsism, poor self-esteem, and raging hormones. Aptly chosen locations and production design collaborate effectively to evoke the scuzzy glamor of resort-town games arcades and golf courses, while Chris Thornborrow andBruce Peninsula‚Äôs elegiac score casts a spell.
Cividino digs beneath the surface, though, to illuminate male-bonding rituals, especially how young men jockey for position and try to assert dominance. Cinematographer James Klopko documents the gorgeous water and beautiful wide-open spaces where these boys are vacationing, but Sleeping Giant consistently undercuts the lakeside eye candy by reminding us of the boys‚Äô unfiltered testosterone, which provokes Riley and Nate to act out and impressionable Adam to follow their lead.
Avec The Sleeping Giant, Andrew Cividino annonce la couleur d‚Äôentr√©e. Son traitement visuel, bien que travers√© par de jolis instants suspendus, fait fi de symbolisme cl√©-en-main, de m√©taphores faciles et autres aff√©teries inh√©rentes aux premiers longs m√©trages sur le sujet.
With Sleeping Giant, Andrew Cividino sets the bar. His visual treatment, although crossed by pretty suspended moments, disregards turn-key symbolism of easy metaphors and other affectations inherent feature debuts on the subject.
Despite a conventional framework, whose broad outlines have been exploited elsewhere until their dregs Cividino successfully prints his sensitivity to the relationships that unite the three boys. Turning his back on sentimentality, he explores the intricacies of a period where everything counts for survival: the weight of words unspoken, buried fears, youthful delusions, etc.
Cividino depicts the tricky male power games between the boys with tact and compassionate impartiality: Adam may be the ‚Äúgood boy‚Äù of the group, but he‚Äôs not averse to a little brattiness. All three young actors excel, convincingly negotiating their characters‚Äô impetuous mood swings and surges of false bravado; newcomers Moffett and Serino return from the film‚Äôs shorter incarnation, while Martin makes a delicate impression in the feature‚Äôs most quietly complex role.
A massive, whooping congrats to @AndrewCividino and @karenharnisch on the @cannes premiere of their fantastic film 'Sleeping Giant'. Woohoo!

Canada‚Äôs economy is gradually recovering and is expected to grow by 2.25 % this year and 2.5 % in 2013, according to a new report by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Private consumption and investment will continue to be the primary drivers of growth in Canada, said the report, which was published Tuesday.
Canada‚Äôs growth will slightly outpace the OECD average, which is expected to be 1.6% in 2012 and 2.2% in 2013.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a great outcome. A generation ago, coming out of a recession like this, we would have thought this was deplorable, but it‚Äôs not bad,‚Äù said Peter Jarrett, senior economist with the organization.
Assuming the euro zone ‚Äúmuddles through‚Äù its crisis, avoiding a Greek exit, Mr. Jarrett said OECD wants the Bank of Canada to start raising interest rates in the fall to avoid speedy inflation that will follow the economic growth.
‚ÄúIn order to head off that eventuality, we assume that beginning in the fourth quarter the Bank would move at a rate of a quarter of a point per quarter, bringing us to a rate of about 2.25 % by end of 2013,‚Äù Mr. Jarrett said.
The benchmark interest rate in Canada has been 1% since September 2010.
A rate hike is also needed to slow down quick-climbing housing prices. ‚ÄúWe also feel that would help cool off the housing market in the places where it‚Äôs been hot and we expect it to remain hot in some of those places, particular in Toronto,‚Äù Mr. Jarrett said.
But if interest rates are increased, mortgages rates are also likely to rise, which could hinder the ability of some homeowners to make their payments. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to end up in the same situation as our neighbours to the south,‚Äù said Mr. Jarrett.
The OECD report flagged Canada‚Äôs housing sector as imbalanced, but noted stiffer lending rules surrounding mortgages have helped reduce risk. The report comes on the heels of a Fitch Rating report released Monday that called Canada‚Äôs fast-climbing housing prices and record household debt levels unsustainable.
‚ÄúThe Bank of Canada is doing its best to ensure that lending is taking place on a prudent basis so that if indeed interest rates do have to go up more suddenly than one might have expected, then the number of people who can‚Äôt afford their houses is not too great and the impact on banks and lending institutions isn‚Äôt too great,‚Äù Mr. Jarrett said.
If Greece does leave its peers ‚Äî the probability of which is rising, according to Mr. Jarrett ‚Äî Canada will feel the effect through the financial markets rather than through its exports or bank-based contagion. Mr. Jarrett said a Greek exit would trigger a rush for low-risk assets, causing commodity prices to fall, and demand for the U.S. dollar, pushing down the loonie.
He said Canadian banks are better positioned than some their international counterparts to withstand a deeper crisis because they don‚Äôt rely as much on whole-sale borrowing. ‚ÄúThe Canadian deposit base is quite solid compared to a lot of other countries,‚Äù Mr. Jarrett said.
Overall the global economy is slowly recovering, the OECD said, but at substantially different rates.
The euro zone crisis is dragging down the overall economic recovery.
‚ÄúThe crisis in the euro zone remains the single biggest downside risk facing the global outlook,‚Äù said OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan in a statement.
Heading into a European Union summit in Brussels this week, the OECD urged leaders to take immediate action to avoid a deepening of the crisis in the euro zone and spillover effects to other nations.
This really should be a list of 15 books I have on pre-order. Maybe someday I will. As for now, I‚Äôm just admiring them from afar on my blog. Check out any of these upcoming releases for 2018 if you want the latest and greatest YA novels.

Synopsis: Five years after the destruction of the so-called rehabilitation camps that imprisoned her and countless other Psi kids, seventeen-year-old Suzume ‚ÄúZu‚Äù Kimura has assumed the role of spokesperson for the interim government, fighting for the rights of Psi kids against a growing tide of misinformation and prejudice. But when she is accused of committing a horrifying act, she is forced to go on the run once more in order to stay alive.
Confession: I haven‚Äôt read this series, YET. I recently borrowed the first instalment from the library.
Synopsis: Fourteen-year-old Stevie lives in Lewes with her beloved vinyl collection, her mum ‚Ä¶ and her mum‚Äôs depression. When Stevie‚Äôs mum‚Äôs disability benefits are cut, Stevie and her mother are plunged into a life of poverty. But irrepressible Stevie is determined not to be beaten, and she takes inspiration from the lyrics of her father‚Äôs 1980s record collection and dreams of a life as a musician. Then she meets Hafiz, a talented footballer and a Syrian refugee. Hafiz‚Äôs parents gave their life savings to buy Hafiz a safe passage to Europe; his journey has been anything but easy. Then he meets Stevie‚Ä¶ As Stevie and Hafiz‚Äôs friendship grows, they encourage each other to believe in themselves and follow their dreams.
This seems a little too sad for me, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll appreciate the topics of government assistance vs resistance (aka refugee policies).

What was done with thousands of children born in the citadel nursery? And most important of all, as forgotten doors are opened and new worlds revealed: Must heroes always slay monsters, or is it possible to save them instead?
I actually hated the first instalment of this book; Stranger the Dreamer. But the book cover is so pretty!
Synopsis: The breathtaking story of five brothers who bring each other up in a world run by their own rules. As the Dunbar boys love and fight and learn to reckon with the adult world, they discover the moving secret behind their father‚Äôs disappearance.

Synopsis: The #1 bestselling series returns with a thrilling new story arc set in America!
Clues to Abe‚Äôs double-life as a peculiar operative start to emerge, secrets long hidden in plain sight. And Jacob begins to learn about the dangerous legacy he had inherited‚Äîtruths that were part of him long before he walked into Miss Peregrine‚Äôs time loop.

New wonders, and dangers await in this brilliant next chapter for Miss Peregrine‚Äôs peculiar children. Their story is again illustrated throughout by haunting vintage photographs, but with a striking addition for this all-new, multi-era American adventure‚Äîfull colour.

Secondly: I have to read this for my boyfriend, who loves the movie for the first screenplay.

Synopsis: Emika Chen barely made it out of the Warcross Championships alive. Now that she knows the truth behind Hideo‚Äôs new NeuroLink algorithm, she can no longer trust the one person she‚Äôs always looked up to, who she once thought was on her side.
I really enjoyed Warcross. I‚Äôm excited to read the next one once it‚Äôs out at the library.
But her new friend has secrets of her own. She can‚Äôt stay in Havnestad, or on two legs unless Evie finds a way to help her. Now Evie will do anything to save her friend‚Äôs humanity, along with her prince‚Äôs heart‚Äîharnessing the power of her magic, her ocean, and her love until she discovers, too late, the truth of her bargain.
Synopsis: What if Ariel had never defeated Ursula? Five years after the (twisted) events of the film, Ariel is now the queen of Atlantica, and Ursula is running Eric‚Äôs kingdom on land. But when the sea witch threatens Atlantica once more, Ariel finds herself returning to a world (and a prince) she thought she‚Äôd left behind forever.

Embarking on a week-long voyage across the Atlantic on the opulent RMS Etruria, they‚Äôre delighted to discover a travelling troupe of circus performers, fortune tellers, and a certain charismatic young escape artist entertaining the first-class passengers nightly.
#12 and #13 I have yet to begin reading (the prequels), but from all the hype from Goodreads, I just had to include them.
Synopsis: Felicity Montague is through with pretending she prefers society parties to books about bone setting‚Äîor that she‚Äôs not smarter than most people she knows, or that she cares about anything more than her dream of becoming a doctor.
A year after an accidentally whirlwind tour of Europe, which she spent evading highwaymen and pirates with her brother Monty, Felicity has returned to England with two goals in mind‚Äîavoid the marriage proposal of Callum Doyle, a lovestruck suitor from Edinburgh; and enrol in medical school. However, her intellect and passion will never be enough in the eyes of the administrators, who see men as the sole guardians of science.
But then a small window of hope opens. Doctor Alexander Platt, an eccentric physician that Felicity idolises, is looking for research assistants, and Felicity is sure that someone as forward thinking as her hero would be willing to take her on. However, Platt is in Germany, preparing to wed Felicity‚Äôs estranged childhood friend Johanna. Not only is Felicity reluctant to open old wounds, but she also has no money to make the trip.
Synopsis: When the California drought escalates to catastrophic proportions, one teen is forced to make life and death decisions for her family in this harrowing story of survival from New York Times bestselling author Neal Shusterman and Jarrod Shusterman.
This year I read Scythe, and I LOVED IT.
Synopsis: Elloren Gardner and her friends were only seeking to right a few wrongs, but their actions have propelled them straight into the ranks of the realm-wide Resistance against Gardnerian encroachment. As the Resistance struggles against the harsh rulings of High Priest Marcus Vogel and the Mage Council, Elloren begins to realize that none of the people she cares about will be safe if Gardneria seizes control of the Western Realm.
With tensions heating up in Verpacia, more and more Gardnerian soldiers continue to descend upon the university‚Ä¶led by none other than Lukas Grey, now commander of the newly rebuilt Fourth Division base. Though Elloren tries to keep him at arm‚Äôs length, Lukas is determined to and fast to her, convinced that she has inherited her grandmother‚Äôs magic‚Äîthe prophesied power of the Black Witch. As his very nearness seems to awaken darkness inside her, Elloren finds it more and more difficult to believe that she‚Äôs truly powerless, as her uncle always claimed.
Black Witch has been on my TBR list for so long (but I‚Äôve been put-off by the controversy of the story), and I was compelled to finish this list with another gorgeous cover.

For transparency, and to keep me motivated, I am going to toss in a weekly weight report. Thursday is a good day to do it since I probably have been eating fairly clean (before heading into the weekend that offers more temptations).
So thanks to some fast days (Tuesday and Thursdays... they are more partial fast days since it simply means that I pretty much have nothing but coffee (with some cream) and some fish oil, though I will toss in some protein shakes if I am working out (with a little BCAA )) I am happy to see the lowest weight in 4 years (basically since I got back from Afghanistan in January 2012 I was 245lb, and by May 2012 I was 265 with a long upward climb until my embarrassment point of April 2015 where I tipped the scales at 287.5).
Good job! I like how you are keeping yourself responsible.

Developing and tuning a new game mechanic is a ton of work, so it does seem like there should be some kind of protection in place, so that someone with more money can't just slap a new coat of paint on it and out-advertise you. But games are also iterative, and we need to let people expand on the ideas of others. It's a tough call.
Except for the Triple/Yeti Town case. That is really, really shameful on 6Waves' part.

How Nueva Ecija farmers are affected by imported garlic?
OK, OK, I lied, but that was the only way I could get bank executives to read a technology missive. This article is really about the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and why it is likely to be the most profound technical innovation in the first decade of the new millennium.
So listen up: XML is going to materially impact your bank, and you need to understand what it is and how it will affect the delivery and cost of information technology services.
Let‚Äôs start by understanding what XML is NOT. It is not a programming language. It is not a financial standard, and it is not a programming interface description. Think of XML as a set of rules and grammar that define a way to communicate. The communication is between computers, and the rules make the specifics of hardware, networks, programming languages, and operating systems irrelevant. If XML had existed in biblical times, the Tower of Babel would have been the Tower of Understanding.
Hopefully you are now getting the drift of XML‚Äôs potential. A few Gonzo issues back, I wrote about how the complexity of banking systems is limiting the choice of new systems available to bankers. (see Why Banks Are Not Changing Core System Vendors) In this article, I illustrate how banks are less and less willing to change systems because of the significant effort (read high cost and risk) of integrating the various disparate pieces. Well this is exactly what XML technology is designed to facilitate ‚Äî communication of information among computers without regard for type, style, brand, or flavor.
A typical mid-sized bank uses between 60 and 150 different software products. Surprised? Most bank executives think the IT staff doesn‚Äôt have enough to do, but you can be certain that keeping these products running is a sizeable task. The level of integration, or data sharing, among various products can lie anywhere between ‚Äútightly connected‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-existent‚Äù. In some instances, a file is exported from one application and imported by another. In others, extensive work is required to make the products interact in real-time. In most cases, there is little or no integration. Now you know why there are information islands in your bank.
The holy grail of banking information has been the ability to see all information on all customers at all points. Most of the systems described above have some information about your customers and your lines of business. Information technologists have been trying to tie the pieces together for years, with little success ‚Äì in part because a business case could not be built that would attach an ROI to the project.
But what if your IT staff could take two products out of the box, install them on your network, and have them communicate with no additional work? What if you wanted to take advantage of a new commercial account analysis product and you could just buy it, install it, and begin using it ‚Äì with virtually no integration cost? What if you could have products from 20 or 30 vendors and not be concerned about interoperability?
What if best of breed system strategies, previously limited to large banks with large IT checkbooks, were now open to everyone?
Make sure your chief technologist (CIO, CTO, VP MIS, or whatever) knows that you understand what XML can do for the future of your bank.
Make sure your current vendors have XML capabilities in their product plans. They should be working on them now and delivering products that are XML-compatible later this year or in early 2003.
Make XML integration capabilities a requirement for all future software system products.
Perhaps the promise of technology will finally be realized through XML. Can I hear an amen, Gonzo brothers and sisters?
The City‚Äôs role should be an advocacy role, one where the City continues to show leadership at the other levels of government, and advocates for what the citizens of Lethbridge want.
Advocacy, first and foremost. Maintaining strong communication with other orders of government is key in ensuring our voice is heard and respected. We also play a key role in keeping our residents informed when decisions that affect them are being made.
The city leaders should advocate for their people, and be a ligation between the citizens and the provincial and federal governments. It is the cities interests we are elected to represent, and when supported by our people our city could shine as an example to the rest of our province and country.
Advocacy on behalf of the People of Lethbridge is a key function of council. To wholeheartedly and effectively advocating for the People is a requirement of Leadership.
As local government representatives, City Council should continue to work closely with our Provincial and Federal levels of government. When decisions are made at a provincial or federal government level that affect the citizens of Lethbridge, City Council must work collaboratively for recommendations and solutions.
It is our responsibility to have good working relationships with other levels of government so that when we need to lobby on our citizens' behalf that we have open lines of communication. This council has those relationships and have been very successful in our lobbying efforts.
The City needs to have open communications with all levels of government, our MP and MLA's. Our role is to clearly articulate the effects of higher level decisions on our residents, to advocate for change if the effect is negative and to be gracious if a higher level decision has a positive effect.
If decisions by the Province continue downloading on municipalities, municipalities, thorough AUMA &amp; AAMD &amp; C, needs to pressure the province to direct funding our way to cover expenses.
The City must have a clear understanding of jurisdictional decisions. This would be as a result of excellent liaison with our local elected provincial and federal representatives. When these decisions affect citizens (ie Federal marijuana laws, Provincial labour laws, fire bans, etc.) the City must ensure that departments ie Police Department, Community Services Departments, are fully trained and prepared to deal with impact(s) resulting from these decisions. Committees and Town Hall meetings with citizens are paramount in ensuring communication and understanding of jurisdictional decisions, the City has to be proactive in these processes.
As with the legalization of marijuana, the city needs to support both the decisions of our government and the needs of our city. Changes don't take place overnight, and we have to have plans in place well in advance of any changes taking affect.
Advocate for the Lethbridge citizens.
Council is a sounding board for our citizens and a first link to the provincial/federal governments. The recent No Drilling Lethbridge decision was perfect example of people being outraged by big oil companies and showing the province that the "power of the people" is still a force in this province. Activism is the "rent you pay" for living on this planet and our citizens showed that to the rest of Canada and the world. Politicians need to remember that the quickest way to piss off an Albertan is to "tell them what to do"
It is important that council have a good working relationship, including open and honest communication, with all levels of government so that we may have a solid voice at the table. The city must abide by all laws passed on a provincial or federal level. It is council jobs to work within the laws to find what works best for our vity.
Advocate through and through, we need to work with all levels of government to obtain the most we can for our citizens. Future funding from the province and federal governments is in question and we must start now to advocate for funding for our future plans.
I believe City representatives have a duty, collectively to speak for the city of the municipality when another level of government adversely affects City interests. It is through open dialogue and diplomacy with other levels of government that solutions become apparent.
Are you talking about the provincial level? If so- Municipal Government Act (MGA) recently went through a major review and unfortunately it did not address all the needs of municipalities. Example- sections 66 / 643 that "grandfather" past decisions were not amended in order to give a city the power to apply changes regarding land-use bylaws; urban drilling/fracking are still under provincial jurisdiction. This means we are subject to 2 levels of governance. All we can do is what we did before ‚Äì fight to drive frackers out of our city. Once prov. legislation is in place its not possible.

This is an article by guest writer Don Campbell of Expand2Web.
Think of the greatest athlete, musician, artist or business professional that inspires you. The amazing talents that really stand out. Michael Jordan. Tiger Woods. Warren Buffett. They were each born with a special gift: wired from birth with talents and abilities that most of us don‚Äôt have access to, right?
Research is showing that it‚Äôs not that simple. In fact, many child prodigies don‚Äôt go on to major success in the area of their early gifts. And many of the greatest performers, athletes and business people never showed any early signs of aptitude.
So, how did they become great at what they do?
A couple of years ago I read an article by Geoffrey Colvin in Fortune, What It Takes To Be Great. The article is fascinating and delves into the question of innate abilities, usually referred as ‚Äúthe talent myth‚Äù.
Nobody is ‚Äúgreat‚Äù without lots of work. Early aptitude is not a predictor for greatness in a given field without consistent practice over a long period of time.
The most accomplished people in any field need about 10 years of hard work before they become ‚Äúworld class‚Äù. They call this the 10 Year Rule.
Many of these scientists are now saying that ‚Äútargeted‚Äù natural gifts do not exist at all. You are not born a CEO or chess grandmaster. Rather, greatness is achieved by hard, focused work over many years.
Charlie Parker, widely considered one of the most influential of Jazz musicians, showed no sign of musical talent as a child. He started playing saxophone at age 11, and was thrown out of his high school band because he was so bad. But this drove him to practice intensively for many years, for four years up to 15 hours a day. It was many years after that before he was noticed.
Tiger Woods started practicing golf at 18 months, and was encouraged to practice by his father. He had been practicing intensively for 15 years before winning the U.S. Amateur Championship at age 18.
But you and I both know people who work very hard. Many work for decades at a job or hobby without approaching greatness. Why don‚Äôt they become ‚Äúworld class‚Äù, then?
It turns out that it‚Äôs not just hard work that is required. What is required is focused, consistent practice over a long period of time. Something the researchers are calling deliberate practice.
Truly great people in any field devote many hours to deliberate practice. Deliberate practice is an activity that goes beyond repetition. It is consistent practice where the goal is to continually improve performance, reaching beyond your current capabilities, and seeking feedback on results.
Simply hitting a bucket of balls is not deliberate practice, which is why most golfers don‚Äôt get better. Hitting an eight-iron 300 times with a goal of leaving the ball within 20 feet of the pin 80 percent of the time, continually observing results and making appropriate adjustments, and doing that for hours every day ‚Äî that‚Äôs deliberate practice.
And what‚Äôs great about these findings is that we can apply them to all areas of our life. Almost any skill is improvable. Giving presentations. Sports. Negotiating. Whatever it is that you do and have a passion for, you can improve and become truly great ‚Äî if you are willing to put in the work, that is.
Approach each critical task with an explicit goal of getting much better at it. Set goals that are just beyond your level of competency.
As you do the task, focus on what‚Äôs happening and why you‚Äôre doing it the way you are.
After the task, get feedback on your performance from multiple sources. Don‚Äôt get emotional about it, and make changes in your behavior as necessary.
Continually build mental models of your situation ‚Äì of your industry, your company, your career. Expand the models to encompass more factors. (A good book on the concept of mental models is The Power of Impossible Thinking by Yoram Wind and Colin Cook).
Do those steps regularly, not sporadically. Occasional practice does not work. Consistency is the key here.
We don‚Äôt have to be born with a special talent in order to be great at something. We just have to have the desire to constantly work at and improve our skill. This is huge: it means that you can learn to be good, or even great at nearly anything!
Most people won‚Äôt go through the long and difficult process of deliberate practice. But this is what can separate you from the pack. This is what makes great performance rare: most people either don‚Äôt believe they can do it, or aren‚Äôt willing to do the work to become truly great at their passion.
So ask yourself, what is your ‚Äòmastery skill‚Äô? What should you work on to improve regularly, practicing, getting feedback, improving and pushing yourself to higher levels of excellence?
Is it your career? Is it a sport? Is it art or music? Now that you know that excellence is a choice, a whole world of possibilities opens up. Are you ready to pursue your dream and become ‚Äúworld class at it‚Äù?
When I read something that I really want to remember, I create a mind map to help me conceptualize what I‚Äôve read. My mind map summary of the article that inspired this post, What It Takes To Be Great, is included below.

With an increasing share of renewable energy sources (RES) in the European Union (EU), the role of energy consumers as active participants in the energy system is bound to expand, as developments in an increasing number of EU Member States demonstrate. A growing number of households, public organizations and small enterprises are likely to produce energy, supply demand-side flexibility or store energy in times of oversupply. So far, however, the extent of this ‚Äòprosumer‚Äô potential in the EU is unknown.
Global and EU-wide decarbonisation scenarios typically model increasing RES capacities, but do not go into the details of how this will be achieved, and what role prosumers, also referred to as energy citizens, could play in these developments.
This study therefore aims to create more insight into the potential of energy citizens in the EU: how many energy citizens could there be in 2030 and 2050 throughout the EU and what is their potential contribution to renewable energy production and demand side flexibility?
The main result of this project is an Excel workbook that contains the detailed quantitative findings of this study. This report provides the background information to these data, describing the context of the study and the methodology used.
The study was commissioned by Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth Europe, the European Renewable Energy Federation (EREF) and REScoop.

The word catechize, is properly Greek, derived from the verb katecheo, to instruct with the voice, which is found, in some of its parts, six or seven times in the New Testament, but is commonly translated to instruct; because in English, the word catechize has somehow acquired a narrower signification than the original term, and conveys the idea of instruction by question and answer; whereas, the word in Greek includes all manner of elementary, oral instruction: and it would be desirable to bring back the word to its original meaning. This, however, is of small moment. The passages in which the original word is found, are the following: Luke 1:4; Acts 18:25; Acts 21:22, 24; Romans 2:18; 1 Corinthians 14:19; Galatians 4:6.
It appears therefore that this mode of instruction is fully recognized in the sacred Scriptures. Indeed, if no other methods of inculcating divine truth were resorted to, than delivering elaborate and continued discourses from the pulpit, very little information would be gained by the young and the ignorant. Preaching supposes and requires some preparatory knowledge in the hearers, to render it useful in communicating religious knowledge. Elementary principles must be acquired in some other way; and this was more especially the case before the invention of printing, when books were very scarce, and few persons were able to read. It seems that the apostles and first teachers of the Christian religion were much occupied in giving religious instruction, from house to house; and we know from undoubted authorities, that in the earliest times of the primitive church, all who applied for admission into the church, from among the heathen, and all the children of Christians, were carefully instructed by catechizing; that is, by a course of familiar teaching, viva voce. To every church a class of catechumens was attached and formed a kind of school, in which the first principles of religion were inculcated, and certain formulas of Christian doctrine, such as the early creeds, carefully committed to memory, together with portions of the sacred Scriptures. In some places these schools for catechumens became very famous, and were supplied with teachers of the highest character for learning and piety; so that they were frequented by the lovers of sacred literature from other countries. A celebrated institution of this sort flourished for several ages at Alexandria, in Egypt in which Origen was educated, and at which he became the most distinguished teacher. A large number of the treatises written by the fathers, in different countries, and in different centuries, were composed expressly for the instruction of the catechumens. And until darkness overspread the church, and her unnatural pastors deprived the people of the Scriptures, the church was, as it ever should be, like a great school, where holy men of God devoted their time to the instruction of the rising generation, and of converts from paganism.
In catechetical, or elementary instruction, the grand secret is, little at a time and often repeated. Whoever would successfully instruct children and very ignorant adults, should avoid the error of crowding too many things into their minds at once. It is as preposterous a practice as it would be to attempt to increase the activity, vigor, and size of the body, by cramming the stomach with as much food as it could hold. Moreover, the truths first communicated should be as simple as possible. Tender minds must not be fed with strong meat, but with pure milk. To accommodate instruction to the state of advancement in knowledge, and to the degree of development of the mental faculties, is certainly that part of education which is most difficult, and at the same time the most important. That historical facts should form the commencement of a course of religious instruction, is indicated, first, by the method pursued in the Bible; and secondly, by the predilection of all children for this species of knowledge. But at a very early period, moral and doctrinal instruction of the most important kind may be connected with the scriptural facts inculcated, and may always be most advantageously engrafted on them. Doctrinal catechisms are, it is admitted, not commonly understood well by children; but it can do them no harm to exercise themselves in committing the words to memory; for it is universally admitted, that to strengthen the memory, it must be frequently and vigorously exercised: and will it not be much better to have it stored with words which contain the most salutary truths, rather than those which may, by some association, prove injurious on the recollection?
Sometimes the having committed to memory such a system as the Shorter Catechism, is of the utmost importance to an individual when his lot is cast where he has no means of correct information; or in case the person should lose his sight or hearing. We once noticed an exemplification of this in the case of a man of strong mind, who had led a busy life, without much concern with books, and who in his latter years was entirely blind. In conversation on the most important topics of religion, in which he took a deep interest, he would continually recur to the answers in the Shorter Catechism, which he had learned when young; and which now seemed to serve as a guide to his thoughts in all his meditations. But the true reason why so many children learn the Catechism without understanding its meaning, is that no pains are taken to explain its doctrines, and to illustrate them, in a way adapted to their capacity. Parents are, for the most part, either incapable of giving such instruction or negligent in the performance of this important duty. Most parents then stand in need of some helps to enable them to explain the meaning of the Catechism; and such helps have been amply provided, and should be in the hands of every Presbyterian family. We have works of this description by Vincent, Flavel, Thompson, and others of former days; and more recently an excellent exposition of the Shorter Catechism by the Rev. Belfrage of Scotland; and still more recently we have a set of Lectures on the Shorter Catechism from the pen of the venerable Doctor Green, in two volumes, which we sincerely wish might be found in every family in our church, as a work of sound theology, written in a correct and perspicuous style. And while we are recommending expositions of this excellent little compend, we would not omit to mention with high approbation, the Rev. Matthew Henry‚Äôs Scriptural Catechism, in which all the questions are derived from those in the Shorter Catechism, and the answers throughout are in the very words of Scripture. This in our opinion is an admirable work, and ought to be reprinted and widely circulated. We are also free to recommend Fisher‚Äôs Catechism, as a valuable doctrinal work, which has been much used in Scotland, and by many Presbyterians in this country. The Key to the Shorter Catechism, we also approve, and from the testimony of those who have tried it, we are led to believe, it may be made very useful in aiding children to understand the meaning of words and phrases used in the Catechism.
The old Presbyterian custom of devoting the Sabbath evening, sacredly, to the business of catechizing the children and domestics, in every family, ought to be revived among us where it has fallen into disuse; no other means which have been substituted for this, are likely to answer as good a purpose. Or, if public services in the church are considered on the whole expedient, on this evening, let an hour in the morning, or immediately after dinner be appropriated to this important work. It is as useful to parents, as to children; and is the most effectual method of inducing young persons to commit the Catechism well to memory. And unless this is done, the religious instruction of servants and domestics will be neglected. These family instructions should be conducted with great gravity and kindness of manner; at such times, chiding and scolding should be avoided; and the addresses to the consciences of delinquents should be made with affectionate tenderness.
We do earnestly hope that attention to doctrinal instruction will not be relinquished, nor diminished in our church. Hitherto, Presbyterians have been distinguished above all people in the world, for a correct and thorough knowledge of the tenets of their own church. No people on earth are so well indoctrinated in the principles of religion, and in the proof of the doctrines believed, as the Scotch, and their descendants in Ireland and America. Other people far exceed them in metaphysical speculations, and in the knowledge of other matters; but for sound religious knowledge, commend us to Scotch Presbyterians of every sect.
The benefits of thorough instruction in the doctrines of religion cannot be calculated. The truths thus received into the mind may prove ineffectual, in some cases, to restrain from open sin; but even in these, the force of the truth is often felt, and the person thus situated, is much more likely to be convinced of the error of his ways than those transgressors whose minds are almost totally destitute of the knowledge of the doctrines of religion. There is, moreover, an unspeakable benefit from the possession of correct doctrinal information, when the mind falls under serious impressions of religion; for then, truths which had been early inculcated, and long forgotten, will revive in the memory, and serve to guard the anxious mind from those enthusiastic errors into which ignorant persons are so prone to fall when they are deeply exercised on the subject of their salvation. Let not the members of the Presbyterian Church, therefore, become remiss in that which has ever been her most honorable distinction; the careful initiation of children into the doctrines of religion, contained in her Catechisms; than which we believe, a sounder system of theoretical and practical theology, cannot be found in any language.
We cannot be contented to let the opportunity pass of bestowing merited commendation on those denominations of Scotch Presbyterians who are not in communion with the General Assembly, for their indefatigable industry and care in giving doctrinal instruction to their children. In this respect, it must be acknowledged, they greatly excel all other denominations of Christians in our country. Among them, we have reason to believe, there has been no falling off in attention to the Catechisms; and few instances ever occur of the members of these churches being seduced by the insidious arts of the propagators of error and infidelity.
The question may occur to some, To whom does it belong to give catechetical instruction? We answer, to all who are capable of teaching anything of divine truth correctly. But, especially, it is the duty of parents, guardians, masters, school-masters, elders and ministers. All who can be enlisted in the service should be engaged to teach those more ignorant than themselves. And we feel constrained to give our testimony strongly in favor of Sunday Schools, in which so many persons are employed, so beneficially to themselves and others, in giving instruction out of the Bible. When this is called a new institution, it surely is not meant that any new instruction is given; or that there is anything new in the manner of communicating religious knowledge. The whole novelty of the thing consists in the success of the attempt to engage such a multitude of teachers in giving lessons, and such a multitude of scholars in learning them. But we would respectfully ask, whether parents, and ministers, and elders, have not become more remiss in catechizing since the introduction of Sunday School?
In order to render the public catechizing of children profitable, the pastor of the flock must manifest a deep and lively interest in the exercise. If he should appear indifferent, and attend on catechetical exercise in a formal or careless manner, no great good can be expected to arise from such meetings; but if he will take pains to arrange all the circumstances of such exercises, so as to render them interesting to old and young; if he will propose special subjects of inquiry, refer to proper books, and converse freely with his people on this topic, a spirit of investigation will be excited, religious knowledge will be pursued with diligence and alacrity, and catechizing will be found to be the most effectual means of diffusing correct information on the doctrines of religion.
If common schools were what they ought to be, seminaries in which Christian doctrine was carefully taught, then our schoolmasters would all be catechists, and the children would be trained in the knowledge of God, and their duty. The business of catechizing youth seems also to be one of the appropriate duties of the eldership; for surely these officers ought not to be restricted to mere matters of order and government. As leaders of the people, they should go before them in religious instruction; and it would be an expedient, as it is a common arrangement, to have each parish so divided into districts, that every elder would have a little charge of his own to look after, the families within which he might frequently visit, and where he might frequently collect and catechize the youth. If ruling elders are commonly incompetent to perform such a work as this, they are unfit for the office which they hold, and can be of little service in the church in other respects. It is now becoming matter of common complaint, that our ruling elders are not generally sensible of the important duties which belong to their office, and are not well qualified to perform them. But how can this evil be remedied? We answer, that the effectual remedy will be found in an increased attention to instruction in the doctrines of the church, by which means many will acquire a taste and thirst for religious knowledge; and whenever this occurs, there will be rapid progress in the acquisition of such a fund of sound theology, as will qualify them to communicate instruction to the young and ignorant. In the mean time, let every pastor meet with the elders of his church, once in the week, for the express purpose of discussing questions which relate to the duties belonging to their office: and thus those who are really desirous of executing their office in a faithful and intelligent manner, will become better and better prepared for their important work every year.
The question has often been agitated whether it would not be expedient to have an order of catechists, whose duty it should be to attend to this whole concern; and the idea has been favorably entertained by some in the Presbyterian church. But to us it appears, that such an office would be worse than useless: for, if the catechist be taken from among the members of the church, where he is expected to officiate, and this must be the case if every church is supplied with one or more, then why not constitute him at once a ruling elder? Surely the mere name of catechist would not qualify him to give instruction; and if he is qualified, would he not be as able to teach, if called by the name elder as catechist? And if the office is judged to be expedient, because we cannot obtain well qualified elders, how can it be supposed that competent catechists could be found? The idea of some, however, is, that to perform the duties of catechizing well, requires much more time than men can commonly afford from their own business; and therefore, proper persons should be employed at a reasonable salary, to devote their whole time to this important branch of instruction. Now all this is very reasonable, and brings us to the very point mentioned before, viz. that schools, among Christians, should have it as their chief object, to bring up children in the knowledge of divine things; and the proper catechists of the church would be the teachers of these schools. If it be said, that school-masters are often incompetent to perform this part of their duty; we reply, that the same thing would be true if they were called catechists; or if other persons were sought for, in the present state of the church, there would exist the same difficulty in obtaining them as there is now in finding well qualified school-masters. The truth is, the church should take pains to train men for this very office; and the parents should set a much higher value on it, than they have been accustomed to do; and the office ought to be rendered more respectable, and more desirable than it is at present.
It may, perhaps, be thought by some, that the prevalence of Sunday schools renders it unnecessary for church officers to concern themselves with the instruction of the youth under their charge. If, indeed, the schools of this description within the parish are under the special superintendence and tuition of the Pastor and Elders, there is no good reason why catechetical instruction should not be given in a Sunday school as well as anywhere else. Catechizing is an exercise peculiarly suited to the Sabbath, and if the officers of any church should agree to conduct this part of the instruction in these valuable institutions, it would certainly be an improvement on the plan on which they are commonly conducted. But when, as is commonly the case, these schools are made up of children of different denominations, and are under the direction of persons not connected with any one church, their existence and prosperity, while it will greatly facilitate pastoral labors, ought not to be considered as a substitute for catechizing. We are afraid, however, that some pastors, as well as many parents, have become remiss in this part of their duty, from the mistaken idea, that their labors in this field are now superseded. This mistake should be carefully counteracted; and while the benefits of Sunday school are gratefully acknowledged, the instruction of our youth in the Catechisms of our own church should be pursued with increasing diligence.
The old Presbyterian plan of conducting catechizing did not confine this method of instruction to children and youth, but extended it to all persons except the officers of the church. And certainly one of the chief hindrances to the success of catechetical instruction has been that it commonly terminates too soon. When children have arrived at the age of twelve or fourteen years, they take up the opinion that they are too big and too old to repeat the catechism; in consequence of which, until the institution of Bible classes, our youth received no appropriate instruction, in many congregations, in that period of their lives which of all others is most important for improvement in knowledge. While we are strong advocates for catechetical instruction, we are at the same time warm friends to the method of instruction pursued in Bible classes; and we should be pleased to see both these methods of instruction extended to all ages and conditions of men; for who is there that has not something yet to learn? And what upon earth is so worthy of time and pains as the knowledge of God‚Äôs word, and the doctrines of his wonderful love and grace? Every man who contributes to the increase of this kind of learning by his writings, should be deemed more a public benefactor than he who invents the most useful machine. Let all, then, whom God has entrusted with so excellent a talent as that of writing well on theology, take heed that they do not hide it in a napkin or bury it in the earth; for never was there a time when there was a greater need of good books and tracts to counteract the floods of error which are issuing from a thousand sources; and never was there a period when the effect of good writing was so extensive. By means of the improvements in printing, and the facilities of conveyance in our day, opportunity is afforded of circulating opinions throughout the land; and if religious men sleep, there is no doubt that the enemy will sow his tares plentifully. Let the friends of truth, therefore, be watchful and wise, and ever on the alert, in seizing opportunities of enlightening the world with the pure doctrines of the word of God.

I write about how an academic is driven to write a musical as the only way to put the story of Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution in context in http://theconversation.com/our-musical-fidel-will-try-to-puncture-the-polarised-debate-about-castro-69508.

Family Photography is not supposed to be something you ‚Äòhave to do‚Äô, it should be fun!! It should be about you spending time away from house work, chores, computers, phones and all those other distracting things and just having fun with your family. Generally this will involve chasing light, or in the case of these guys, jumping fences to chase light. Its ok, no one caught us! hehe. I also love a good muck around with confetti and bubbles (Kmart you rock for bubbles and confetti!). I love the faces that the kids get when I say I have a surprise in my bag for them, it‚Äôs truly priceless!
The weekend just past I headed on a little road trip with my finance Caleb to visit his parents in Echuca. With a busy wedding season, lots of family sessions in time for Christmas and lots of little bubs coming into the studio i‚Äôve had a super busy past few months. So it was really nice to take a break. We headed down through Benella and then to Shepparton where Caleb let me go a little bit loose in a few Op Shops (Vinnies was my favourite in Shepparton). Op Shops are my favourite place to shop! You just never know what you‚Äôll find. And Caleb is so patient waiting there for me. This time we even found him a pair of shorts! Anyway, we made our way to Echuca and enjoyed an even of cooking (Caleb‚Äôs dad is an amazing cook!), a few drinks, sunshine and then we settled around the fire listening to Jack Johnson play in the background. It was simply bliss. Just to relax, chat, laugh, eat.
So what do you do in your family fun time? Do you hang out with other families maybe? Go for a picnic (cant go wrong with a good cheese platter, lets be honest)? Or down to the park?
Enjoy some fun moments from this session!

I didnt know u took my joke so hard Vicky.
Please take care and Get well soon, Vicky!
If you‚Äôre considering undertaking a significant project like an engine swap on any vehicle at all, you should spend some time considering the level of involvement you want and, perhaps more importantly what your budget will allow. Let‚Äôs face it, if your wallet is big enough, you can have an engine installed in your Fiero without even getting your hands dirty. On the other hand, this site is geared towards those with a limited budget who might be looking for a fun project to work on. At many points during the build, you might have the option to purchase a part, kit or service to simplify the process, like a wiring loom or engine mounts for example, time constraints may play a part here as well.
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much value to be had in going over the ‚Äòstandard‚Äô tools that you might need like a socket set, wrenches, screw drivers, pliers, vise grips, hammer, etc other than to recommend that you get decent quality tools. I personally, always try to buy tools with a lifetime warranty, like Mastercraft or better still Craftsman ‚Äì on the two occasions that I have returned a Craftsman tool, I got a straight exchange immediately, no receipt required and no paperwork to fill out.
One thing that almost caught me out near the completion of my project was insurance. It hadn‚Äôt really occurred to me that ‚Äòregular‚Äô insurance companies might not be overly enthusiastic about insuring a heavily modified vehicle. Fortunately, I found a company called Zehr‚Äôs that offers a special classic car insurance. This allows me to drive the car but with some limitations, for example, I have to have another main vehicle insured and I don‚Äôt use the Fiero as a daily driver. It also requires the car to be of a certain vintage, so bear that in mind if you‚Äôre starting with a more modern vehicle. One of the requirements for getting the insurance was that I had to get the car appraised. Kijiji provided contact details for quite a few local appraisers, I paid $130 for a nice, well presented report and valuation. Right now I‚Äôm happy to use my Fiero as a toy so I haven‚Äôt found a way to insure a 3800 SC Fiero as a daily driver, if you have, please use the contact us page to let me know how.
As well as the insurance, you should also check out the local laws concerning how to register your modifications and get your project legally road-worthy. Here in Ontario, Canada, I was able to get a safety inspection done, change the number of cylinders on the registration document and then get ‚Äòfit for road use‚Äô plates on the vehicle. When I registered the car in my name, the book of values used to calculate the tax reported zero value, probably just based on age. So instead, I had to get another appraisal (that basically consisted of a form that needs to be completed by a approved appraiser) to get a value that they then used to calculate how much tax I had to pay. Just make sure that you understand what‚Äôs needed to get road legal before you invest too much of your time and/or money.
Oh man, I tore the pockets on quite a few sets of pants and overalls getting to the workbench in those days!
Obviously, you will need a good selection of tools to complete your project, perhaps the first thing you will need (and needs to be thought of in the section above) is a good workbench. I was fotunate enough to pick up an old hand made carpenters bench for free, I repaired the top with an old wooden mantel piece and now it is brilliant! On the workbench I fitted a large vise that my brother-in-law kindly fixed me up with, it has been invaluable throughout the build ‚Ä¶ and still is.
Certainly a welder should get some careful consideration. Even though mine has been gathering dust lately, I don‚Äôt know how I ever managed without one in the past. I went with a Lincoln Flux-Cored Arc Welder (FCAW) after hitting some reliability issues with the feed mechanism on a cheaper brand ‚Äì as my brother will tell you, buy cheap, buy twice! I taught myself to weld through a great deal of practise when fixing up an Eagle Talon. If you‚Äôre new to welding though, it would be well worth seeing if there are any courses at the local college or something so that you can get an appreciation of things like weld penetration and proper welding techniques. One of the most difficult things I find with welding is working with thin and/or corroded metal, even on low power settings, you end up blowing holes all over. The only thing I have found to help, is to try to put a bit of extra time and effort into cleaning and preparing the area to ensure good electrical contact. If you‚Äôre going to be doing some welding then you will almost certainly need some metal working tools like a saw, angle grinder, hand files, etc and make sure that you have a fire extinguisher readily available, BEFORE you start!
If you‚Äôre starting with a full car and have to remove the existing power plant, it won‚Äôt be long before you need a hoist. I didn‚Äôt think about needing a hoist until I had the engine on the trailer ready to take home and it dawned on me that I had no way to lift it off! I was lucky that the guy that sold me the engine also agreed to sell me his hoist and didn‚Äôt rip me off! Of course, now I have this thing stood in my garage and only really need it if I want to take the engine out again (maybe this winter?).
This is a good time to bring up lifting safety, it pays to be very careful when lifting heavy objects. Ensure that all the lifting equipment, including the chain/straps are rated for the mass of the object being lifted and always check the condition of your equipment. I was using some heavy duty tie-downs wrapped around the engine to lift it at first, until I noticed that a small bolt on the bottom of the engine had ripped a hole in one of the straps. After that I got some chain and used that instead but I also used a temporary link for hooking and un-hooking the chain, even though the link was rated well above the weight of the engine, it failed and scared the life out of me!!
Fortunately it didn‚Äôt totally fail and still managed to hold the engine long enough for me to lower it back onto the bench. Less than a minute before this, I had my arm underneath the engine lining up some parts! A reminder to always be mindful of safety.
Another thing to watch for is damage to the object being lifted. When I switched to using chain, I found that a couple of tubes and plastic components got damaged when the weight of the engine pulled the chain tight against them. Thinking about it now, it would have been worth the time to make some kind of beam to hold the chain off the top of the engine ‚Äì next time.
Before I got to making the exhaust, I managed to get jobs done using a recipricating saw and a hack saw but for the exhaust there were so many cuts that wanted to be straight and ‚Äòaccurate‚Äô that I needed something better. Ideally I would have bought a band saw, but my limited budget pushed me to get a chop saw instead. It did save a bit of space but if I did it again, I‚Äôd hold out for a band saw.
I kept a fairly comprehensive record of everything I bought for the Fiero project, I‚Äôm sure that if I did another swap now, it would be very different. This list includes things like specialist tools, parts, services and everything I could think of that I spent money on for the project. It‚Äôs definitely not 100% accurate and I think I was quite lucky with the condition of my Fiero but it does give an idea of how it is possible to build a sports car on a very low budget. Prices are in $CDN and were incurred around 2006 ‚Äì 2010.

Last year, Tanqueray resurrected Tanqueray Malacca Gin, a product that it had killed almost a decade ago. It was a surprising move ‚Äì why would Diageo bring back an old, discontinued product for a small limited time release? When you look at the numbers for the gin category, it must have been an fairly difficult pitch by the Tanqueray team to get Diageo to greenlight the special limited release. If you just look at volume, gin doesn‚Äôt really seem like a blockbuster spirit. In 2013, total volume for the gin category was down a whopping 3.8% (source: DISCUS) with a 0.6% drop in gross revenue. Hardly compelling data, and on paper not nearly enough to justify investing significant money producing and distributing a limited release product.
It‚Äôs when you start to look at the broader picture of gin that the move begins to make more sense. Yes, general volume may have declined last year, but that drop was mostly at the very low end of the gin category, categorized as ‚Äúvalue gin‚Äù. These gins are the ones on the bottom shelf of liquor and grocery stores and often are sold in giant liter bottles rather than conventional 750ml. It was at this end of the category where the volume dropped the most (-6.9%), but that drop was offset by some significant growth in the high end gin space, which saw a 5% growth in volume and an impressive 6.3% growth in gross revenue. It turns out that people are drinking less ‚Äòbad‚Äô gin and drinking a lot more ‚Äògood‚Äô gin.
The real story of gin extends beyond the raw sales numbers. If you go to any craft cocktail bar in the world, odds are you‚Äôll see several classic gin drinks on the menu. In the 1800s, gin was an extremely popular spirit, and as such it was used as the base for many of the great classic cocktails, like the Martini, Negroni, Aviation, and Bijou. Gin has been a key element in the craft cocktail revolution and a spirit that many craft bartenders are passionate about. Part of this passion comes out of the sheer opportunity to change perceptions about gin in the United States.
For a number of reasons, gin has gotten an unfairly bad reputation in the United States, where you‚Äôre more likely to find people who say they hate gin than love it. This ‚Äúgin resistance‚Äù is fairly regionalized to the United States and seems to dramatically dissipate when you look toward other countries. Why is gin so beloved in the UK, Spain, and the rest of Europe while many Americans have put it on their ‚Äúdo not drink‚Äù list? The answer may be more about what gin is being mixed with than the quality or taste of the gin itself. In the United States, tonic water is a pale variation of the tonic in the rest of the world. The key reason is highly muted levels of quinine (the element that makes tonic bitter), as well as the use of high fructose corn syrup in many commercial tonics. High fructose corn syrup mixes horribly with gin and helps produce the off taste that many Americans have grown to dislike. The difference in taste and quality between US tonics and their European counterparts (even under the same brand name) is even more dramatic than that between Coke in the United States and Mexican Coke, which is made with pure cane sugar. Bad tonic, combined with a general lack of knowledge in using and handling vermouth in the US, have lead to a bevy of gin drinks that are worthy of US drinkers‚Äô disdain.
So how do you change the hearts and minds of American drinkers and get them to discover the magic spirit that is gin? Tanqueray‚Äôs answer is to get their products into the hands of the people who do the best job mixing gin into drinks that Americans will not only drink, but that they will downright crave. Tanqueray‚Äôs commitment to the craft cocktail revolution has been exceptional, and therein lies the answer to the question, why would a monster company like Diageo bother with a handful of cases of a long lost product? American craft bartenders asked Tanqueray to bring back Tanqueray Malacca, and Tanqueray listened. The move not only created more good will among craft bartenders with the brand, it also helped create some excitement for the category. This excitement also helped fuel a relaunch of Tanqueray‚Äôs iconic Tanqueray Ten Gin with a new look that tipped its hat to craft.
If there‚Äôs one model that major spirits companies tend to follow, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúIf it worked once, do it again‚Äù. While Tanqueray Malacca Gin may not have sold tens of thousands of cases, it did the job that was intended, so Diageo has opened up Charles Tanqueray‚Äôs legendary recipe book for another limited edition gin release. This time around, it‚Äôs Tanqueray Old Tom Gin.
Old Tom Gin is a style of gin that bridges the gap between Dutch Genever and London Dry Gin. At its core, Old Tom Gin has a weight, sweetness, and lushness that‚Äôs reminiscent of Genever but with a drier finish that‚Äôs more akin to a London Dry Gin. Old Tom Gin was an extremely popular style of gin during the heart of the classic cocktail heyday in the 1800s, and can be found in many key classic drink recipes like the Martinez and Tom Collins. Unfortunately, Old Tom Gin was one of many spirits which fell victim to Prohibition, and post-prohibition production of Old Tom petered out in the 1930‚Äôs and 40‚Äôs. It was considered a ‚Äúlost spirit‚Äù in the US until just a few years ago when cocktail historian David Wondrich helped encourage Ransom Spirits, a small Oregon distiller, to try to re-create the classic spirit.
Tanqueray Old Tom Gin (47.3% ABV / 94.6 proof, $32.99 per Liter) ‚Äì unlike Ransom Spirit‚Äôs Old Tom Gin, which was a recreation of Old Tom Gin, Tanqueray‚Äôs special Limited Edition release comes directly out of Charles Tanqueray‚Äôs famed recipe book, with notes on Old Tom Gin that date back to 1835. These notes and subsequent recipes were the basis for Tanqueray Master Distiller Tom Nichol to create this limited Old Tom Gin release for Tanqueray.
From the first nosing, it‚Äôs clear that Tanqueray‚Äôs Old Tom Gin is distinctly different from Tanqueray‚Äôs other gins. Juniper is definitely a lead note, but it‚Äôs accompanied by a distinct lushness that includes bright lime, almond, and orris root. The core of Tanqueray‚Äôs Old Tom Gin nose is sweet citrus (reminiscent of honey tangerine) supported by a layer of spice which includes juniper, black pepper, coriander, and licorice root. The entry is lush and sweet, two words you don‚Äôt expect to be associated with gin. The initial softness is amazing considering that this gin is 47.3% ABV; it‚Äôs perhaps one of the most sippable gins on the market. What‚Äôs remarkable is that the sweetness doesn‚Äôt seem to be coming from any added sugar. It would have been perfectly acceptable to add sugar to an Old Tom Gin, as many classic Old Toms were sweetened, but instead the sweetness is one of those great magical things that can happen in a spirit where it tastes sweet but isn‚Äôt sweetened.
The entry is all sweet lime and soft juniper. The way in which the juniper is presented here is so approachable, it‚Äôll make even the most ardent ginaphobe reconsider their take on the spirit. As we head towards the midpalate there‚Äôs a wonderful handoff between the lush, sweet opening and the full, round, spicy midpalate. In the midpalate the juniper ramps up and is joined by black pepper, coriander, licorice root, orris root, and a eucalyptus note. Even with all this spice, Tanqueray‚Äôs Old Tom Gin maintains the silky undercurrent of citrus sweetness established in the opening. The finish for Tanqueray‚Äôs Old Tom Gin is long and dry, solidly in line with the house style for Tanqueray.
One of the cornerstone‚Äôs of Tanqueray‚Äôs taste profile is balance, and it‚Äôs one of the things that Master Distiller Tom Nichol does best. Nichol manages to find balance in an Old Tom, something that‚Äôs nothing short of remarkable. While Tanqueray Old Tom Gin is being billed as a Limited Edition, it‚Äôs still a Diageo product, so for them ‚Äúlimited‚Äù means ‚Äúa hundred thousand bottles‚Äù. This is a hearty amount for something that‚Äôs limited, but that‚Äôs a good thing. Tanqueray‚Äôs Old Tom Gin is an important addition to the gin category. It‚Äôs an expertly crafted gin that sits side by side with Tanqueray London Dry and Tanqueray Ten in terms of quality and execution. We hope Tanqueray will consider adding both Old Tom and Malacca to the permanent Tanqueray line up.
Have leftover ham you don‚Äôt know what to do with? Check out these 15+ ways to use leftover ham that will have you looking forward to the leftovers!
Ham makes for a great party or holiday gathering main dish. However, it‚Äôs pretty much inevitable that you‚Äôre going to have some ham leftovers that you‚Äôre wondering how to use.
While you can easily freeze your ham to use within the next few months, you can also use it in a lot of dishes to change things up. Check out these 15 ways to use leftover ham.
1. Add it to your scrambled eggs or omelet for breakfast. I love a protein-packed breakfast of scrambled eggs with diced ham and a sprinkle of cheese.
2. Make hash. There‚Äôs just something warming about a hearty hash to start the day with, though I enjoy it for dinner, too.
Besides, what‚Äôs not to love about a mix of fried potatoes, ham, onions and whatever else your stomach desires?
3. Use it in a pasta salad. Pasta salads are a great way to use up a variety of leftovers. Check out our recipe for pasta salad with peas and ham for a delicious way to use leftover ham.
4. Use it as a topping for baked potatoes. Baked potatoes make for a quick low-mess dinner. Broccoli, cheese, and ham would be a great topping trio.
5. Add it to fettuccine alfredo. Who doesn‚Äôt love creamy alfredo sauce? Add in some frozen peas and diced ham for a complete meal. I so love the bit of saltiness the ham adds!
6. Make split pea soup. If you have ham with a leftover bone, making split pea soup is a perfect way to use it.
I actually look forward to having a bone-in ham just to make this soup! Make sure you leave a little bit of meat on the bone and also some ham to add in.
7. Make a quiche or frittata. Quiche, which has a crust, and frittata, which does not have a crust, is the perfect dish to make when you‚Äôre trying to clean out the fridge.
You can add all sorts of meats, veggies, and cheese and it‚Äôs a great meal to start or end the day with. Using ham instead of sausage in our mini frittatas recipe would be delicious!
8. Turn it into a sandwich. Using leftover ham in a sandwich is probably one of the most traditional ways to use up the leftovers.
Instead of the same old ham and cheese, make a croissant sandwich, grilled ham and cheese, or even a Croque Monsieur.
9. Make a breakfast casserole. Ham and eggs are a classic combo for a reason ‚Äì they‚Äôre darn good together!
One of my favorite ways to use leftover ham is to put it in my delicious overnight eggs benedict casserole complete with homemade hollandaise sauce.
If you have bread that is about to go stale, you can easily whip up a breakfast casserole and use ham as your protein. It also makes for a great breakfast for dinner meal.
10. Put it in scalloped potatoes. I love a scoop of rich cheesy scalloped potatoes with ham mixed in. Here‚Äôs my favorite recipe for cheesy scalloped potatoes.
11. Mac and cheese with ham. Turn mac and cheese from a tasty side dish to main dish star by adding in some diced ham.
11. Ham and swiss quesadillas. While ham and swiss sandwiches are yummy, turning them into ooey gooey warm quesadillas are even better!
13. Chicken Cordon Bleu ‚Äì A classic dish using ham that is perfect to use those last remaining leftovers of ham.
14. Add it to a salad. During the weekday, most of my lunches consist of salad topped with a variety of veggies and whatever leftover protein we have in the fridge.
Ham is one of my favorites to use in a salad with its slightly salty bite.
15. Use it as a pizza topping. There‚Äôs the classic Hawaiian style pizza of ham and pineapple, or ham pairs well with other meats and toppings like mushrooms and onions.
16. Make fried rice. Fried rice is another way I like using up random odds and ends in the fridge, plus it‚Äôs one of Mr. Savvy‚Äôs favorites.
With leftover rice, cubed ham and a bag of mixed veggies, this meal goes together easily.
What are some of your favorite ways to use leftover ham?

Fresholi Bites: A Bit Of Catch Up!
Oh my goodness, it seems like an age since I last posted to the blog. I have just been so busy with Fresholi things that I have not even had much time to spend around the Melting Pot forum. Anyway, I thought I best do a bit of catching up.
Lamesoft PO 65 This is an interesting ingredient. It an Ecocert registered ‚Äògreen‚Äô biolipid derived from 100% natural and renewable materials. This mild and gentle skin care additive has been designed for use in green cleansing concepts to improve skin feel, enhance skin lipid layer and act as a natural thickener in green surfactant based formulas. It can be used in a wide range of applications, from lotions to bubble bath.
Ethox (Inci phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin) is a reliable, biodegradable, paraben-free preservative that offer‚Äôs a broad, balanced spectrum effect on bacteria, yeasts and mould fungi. A good choice for natural formulations except for those containing surfactants (where efficacy may be lost).
Essential Oils there have been a few that have sneaked on over the past few weeks but the most recent one is Roman Chamomile (English). There has been a poor harvest so finding a good quality oil at a good price has been so incredibly difficult. The range is gradually growing and I have to say, although it can cause a headache or two, it is an absolute joy sourcing good quality essential oils as I have the opportunity to submerge myself in a world that I dearly love and am very passionate about.
Pure Absolutes Finding good quality essential oils is wonderful but oh.... you can only imagine the pleasure I have had finding pure absolutes. I am so very, very pleased with my finds, which include linen blossom, jasmine sambac, hyacinth and the most incredible frangipani with a most beautiful musky/powdery undertone that just lingers and lingers. All the absolutes are supplied in their purest forms.
I have also given the supplies area a bit of a facelift, which should help make navigating it a little more easy. Do have a look and see what you think. I have plans to introduce some new products very soon as well as increase choices in the ranges already available.

Bob tells his colonoscopy story. He says, "I had a really good experience with my doctors.... [everything was good] no polyps, no nothing, and they said don't come back for ten years. For anyone who is apprehensive about this, it's really not that bad at all."
‚ÄúThe beginnings of IAYPIC ‚Äì the Irish Association of Young People in Care began as far back as April 1995. The Childcare Committee of the Irish Association of Social Workers (IASW), which I chaired, brought together a group of young people in care alongside other agencies including the Irish Foster Care Association (IFCA) and the Children‚Äôs Legal Centre; and the ‚ÄòYoung People in Care Support Network‚Äô was established. This group faded away unfortunately after about six months due to lack of support. The following year, when the IASW was meeting with the Department of Health regarding the setting up of the Irish Social Services Inspectorate (which later became HIQA) the Department offered me an opportunity to bring a group of young people in care, into the Dept. of Health to give their own views on the setting up of the Inspectorate and the Care System overall. This took place in October 1996, and one of the priority items on the young peoples‚Äô agenda was to receive a commitment from the Dept. of Health to provide funding to set up a professionally run organisation to represent the voice of young people in care and care leavers. This group met again a few weeks later in an office in Focus Point (which later became Focus Ireland) and I believe that this was when we formally called themselves IAYPIC (following the Australian Organisation AAYPIC, and VOYPIC in Northern Ireland).
This was a very powerful way for the Department and the Health Boards to be seen as listening to the voice of children in care (good practice).
There were other formal and informal meetings with the Dept. of Health including with Frank Fahy ‚Äì TD who continued to be very supportive over the years, plus an important meeting with the Eastern Health Board (EHB) (at the request of the Dept. of Health) to get their backing. In March 1999 we were surprised to hear from the EHB that they were giving us a grant of ¬£50,000 (Irish Pounds). Our next surprise was when I discovered that it was very difficult to lodge ¬£50,000 due to banking regulations regarding money laundering! However, after formalising a contract with Barnardos to host IAYPIC throughout its set-up stage, the money was transferred to Barnardos. The Manager of Barnardos‚Äô Guardian ad Litem service at that time was tasked with supporting IAYPIC. Her first job was to manage the recruitment of a National Co-ordinator, and we were then very lucky to get Catherine Carty to come on board with all her commitment and hard work to establish IAYPIC on a firm footing‚Äù.

Vitamin E is a vital compound that is necessary for the human body to grow and develop normally. It is primarily responsible for its role in the metabolic processes within the body as well as its role in keeping the immune system strong. According to the National Institutes of Health ([NIH], 2016a), vitamin E occurs naturally in eight forms, including alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-tocopherol. Alpha-tocopherol, however, is the only form that is recognized as being able to meet the needs of humans.
Free radicals can cause a great deal of damage to the body, potentially contributing to the development of cardiovascular disease and cancer. As a fat-soluble antioxidant, vitamin E helps quell the formation of a particular type of the radicals, reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are formed by the body when it converts food to usable energy. Vitamin E limits the production of ROS in select circumstances, which researchers believe may potentially help prevent the onset of chronic diseases (NIH, 2016a).
The list of food sources of vitamin E is long and centers on nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables. Vegetable oils, such as soybean, safflower and sunflower, as well as nuts and seeds, like peanuts, peanut butter and sunflower seeds, are among the best sources (NIH, 2016b). Just one tablespoon of wheat germ oil, for example, contains 100 percent of the Daily Value for the vitamin ‚Äì or 20.3 milligrams. Other important sources of vitamin E include fortified cereals and leafy green vegetables; although, most Americans get the bulk of their vitamin E from sources such as vegetable oils like soybean, canola and corn (NIH, 2016a).
A deficiency in vitamin E among Americans is rare. When it does occur, it is often linked to other health conditions, such as diseases that make it difficult for the body to absorb fat. These conditions increase the need for vitamin E such that more of the nutrient must be ingested. Examples of these conditions include cystic fibrosis and Crohn‚Äôs disease.
Vitamin E supplements often contain amounts of this element that are far higher than the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA). As a result, people who take blood thinners and other types of medications could be harmed by taking supplemental vitamin E. Caution should be exercised and a physician's advice should be sought when considering taking supplements containing the vitamin (NIH, 2016b).
There are many foods that provide vitamin E and, as stated, most Americans face no potential deficiency of the vitamin. As such, we‚Äôve focused on recipes that provide not only this nutrient, but also those that contribute to a well-balanced and complete diet.
A brilliant way to start the day, this delectable pudding blends potent sources of vitamin E in the forms of almonds and sunflower seeds. It‚Äôs also a source of vitamin A and essential minerals like zinc and calcium!
Spirulina and spinach both supply a source of vitamin E in this scrumptious beverage which offers a tart taste and an abundance of other nutrients to make it a healthy choice for anytime.
Adding vitamin E to your diet is simple with these scrumptious snacks. Discover delicious sources of the nutrient with the recommendations from our registered dietitian below!
This scrumptious spread pairs well with any bread or cracker to supply an extra burst of flavor. In addition to providing a preponderance of protein and fiber- almonds are a rich source of vitamin E with each quarter-cup of the nuts supplying 34% of the Daily Value (DV) for the vitamin (NIH, 2016a).
Sunflower seeds provide a potent provision of vitamin E with 37% of the DV for the nutrient in each quarter-cup. These seeds have been prepared with a redolent tamari seasoning which features a flavor reminiscent of soy sauce (NIH, 2016a).
This piquant pairing of sweet and spicy flavors offers a palatable provision of fiber with 2 grams of the carbohydrate in each serving. The fruit also offer vitamin E in each spicy-hot helping, about 4 milligrams of vitamin E, per ounce.
Filberts are full of vitamin E with 4.3 milligrams in each ounce of the nuts, accounting for 22% of the DV for the nutrient. Our nuts have already had their shells removed to create an easy-to-eat snack ready right out of the bag. Try mixing them with almonds and other nuts for a blend of tastes and textures.
These scrumptious snacks supply a healthy alternative to traditional chocolate treats that are equally, if not more, delicious. The almonds inside provide both a crunchy texture and a rich source of nutrition, while the dark chocolate coating adds beneficial antioxidants to the mix.
Our honey roasted peanuts are supremely saccharine with a naturally sweet flavor that doesn‚Äôt overwhelm the sense, but pairs perfectly with the creamy, crunchy texture of the snack. Peanuts provide protein and contain 11% of the DV for vitamin E in every ounce (NIH, 2016a).
This super-seaweed does it all with ample amounts of iron in every serving. The potent powder can be easily added to smoothies for a post-workout provision of protein. The powder also offers a modest amount of vitamin E, along with nutrients that include omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin C, and calcium.
T or F? A common long-term goal may involve saving for collage for parents of a newborn child. True.
What is the Rule of 72? Allows you to divide your interest rate by 72 and find how long it takes for your investment to double.
The naked 180ft Cerne Abbas Giant ‚Äì thought to be thousands of years old ‚Äì is carved out in the chalk downs in North Dorset.
Women living near the carving have an average of three children in their lifetime ‚Äì a national record.
They are the highest birth-per female figures in Britain for more than 40 years.
Locals think the giant could be having an inspirational effect on couples in the area.
Nursery manager Katie Raine said the increasing number of children at the Archway Nursery in Pimperne ‚Äì which is in sight of the Giant ‚Äì were living proof of the findings.
‚ÄúWe can take 73 children in any one day and we‚Äôre absolutely chock-a-block,‚Äù she said.
The findings, from a survey of 10,000 North Dorset women aged between 15 and 44, placed the district at the top of the charts, leaving the London borough of Westminster at the bottom, with just 1.16 children per woman.
Samantha Beadman, deputy manager of Winterbournes Day Nursery in Winterbourne Kingston, said news of the area‚Äôs chart-topping fertility rate came as a surprise.
The new figures are based on research conducted last year. The findings showed a drop in the fertility rate for the first time since 2001.
Birth rates had been rising steadily since the millennium, reaching 1.97 per woman in 2008, from a base line of 1.65 in 2000.
North Dorset‚Äôs survey-topping fertility rate beats the highest recorded national average, when figures recorded in 1964 revealed women were likely to produce 2.93 children in a lifetime.
how long to approve PE application in Texas?
Hi, I understand this is the mailing address if I send my materials via USPS regular mail: Texas Board of Professional Engineers 1917 S Interstate 35, Austin, TX 78741-3702 But is the mailing address the same if I send via UPS, FedEx or USPS Express Mail? I thought express mails have to been sent to "a person" with a phone number, is that correct? Please advise! Thank you!
alright. finally i can get back to work. productivity has been very low today.
in 24 hours? the info from the board is so not reliable !!
so it's now in the board's hand to decide when to release .
i used the little chat with on NCEES website, and here is the reply: Elizabeth C.The results have already been released to the state boards. Some boards have already released to individuals. As soon as the state board where you took the exam gives permission to NCEES to post the results into your account, we will do so.
didn't someone mention that Texas was usually one of the first states to release results ?? any historical data to support ?
I just Googled ‚ÄúTale of the Fox‚Äù just to see where I might fall in the pecking order.

A blog from the video available on SAP Web IDE channel.
This is in continuation with my previous blog https://blogs.sap.com/2017/02/01/git-basics-in-sap-web-ide-understanding-git/ . Refer to this blog, if you are not aware of how to create a GIT repository.
Cherry Picking a Feature means to take a commit from some other branch, and playback in desired / current branch.
This is required, for instance, if bug is fixed in one branch and we may need it to bring to another branch.
1.Create a local branch. Call it a ‚ÄúFeature‚Äù branch.
2. Make any changes in Feature branch.
3.Create a file ‚ÄúCommonMethods.js‚Äù in util folder. Our Project Explorer and git pane should be somewhat like this.
4.Click on Stage All, write Commit Description and Commit.
5. Check master branch, there won‚Äôt be any util folder. See below.
6. Now we want to commit this change to our local branch. For now its ‚Äúmaster‚Äù. This will be known as cherry picking new feature to local branch. Cherry picking Feature Branch to Master branch.
Go to GIT history pane, then ‚ÄúFeature‚Äù branch. Select the branch. Click on Cherry-Pick.
Important : Make sure master branch is selected in GIT pane. As this is our local branch and we want new changes from feature branch to be reflected here.
After few seconds, desired commit will be cherry picked.
We are having util folder in our local branch now.
Now Push the changes of master branch to origin/master.
This is done with Cherry-Picking.
Please feel free to provide your queries/doubts/suggestions/corrections.
TFW there's an awkward silence.
Kourtney Kardashian had an awkward on-air moment Thursday morning when hosts of an Australian morning program asked how her sister Kim Kardashian is holding up after her robbery ordeal.
The questions was met with bizarre silence, while the reality TV star sat staring off camera, presumably listening to the panicked advice of her publicists.
Making matters worse, the connection was dropped. When producers got Kardashian back on the line post-ad break, she explained "we had a bad connection."
"I think she's totally blanking me on that question," said David Campbell, co-host of Today Extra, adding, "She could just say her sister is fine! I mean I think we just said that you know we're very concerned and we were onside and we hoped that everyone's fine, which I still do."
According to The Herald Sun, Kourtney insisted that she be re-connected to the show‚Äôs host in order to address the question. Once connected, she discussed how the Kardashian klan was feeling after her sister was held at gunpoint during the Paris robbery.
"I think we're all really still shaken up and I just ‚Äî you know, I think she has a big supportive family and I know that, like, all of the traumatic things that we've been through, you know, we get through them together as a family and that's what family is all about," she said.
While it might not be the most informative response ever uttered, it may have been worth it as an act of "saving face." What's a potential little white lie about a technical glitch between friends, anyway?
Many of us would love to use the old "we just had a bad connection" excuse to get out of conversations IRL, sometimes.
Abstract A new ionic liquid, PMIInCl4, was prepared by mixing 1-methyl-3-pentylimidazolium chloride (PMIC) with InCl3. The molar enthalpies of solution of PMIC and PMIInCl4 in water to form solutions at various molalities were determined at 298.15 K using an isoperibol calorimeter. Using Pitzer's electrolyte solution model, the molar enthalpies of solution of PMIC and PMIInCl4 at infinite dilution, Delta(sol) H-m(o), and Pitzer's ion-interaction parameters beta((0) L)(MX) beta(( 1)L)(MX) and C-MX(phi L), were derived. The values of the apparent relative molar enthalpy L-phi and relative partial molar enthalpy of the solutes (PMIC and PMIInCl4), (L) over bar (2),were subsequently calculated. Using the values of Delta(sol) H-m(o) of PMIC, PMIInCl4 and InCl3, the enthalpy change, Delta H-r = - 38.19 kJ . mol(-1), was calculated for the reaction PMIC + InCl3 --> PMIInCl4.

A City of Austin review of short-term or vacation rental homes, which began 18 months ago, soon spawned a version of what Council Member Bill Spelman jokingly called this week "the famous Austin stakeholder process," in which seemingly everyone gets a say.
Now, Spelman said, it is time to let numbers do the talking.
Spelman seeks to suspend the review so that the city auditor can determine how many short-term rentals exist, where they are located and their impact on neighborhoods. He said available data on short-term rentals is insufficient and conflicting.
Today, the council is scheduled to consider suspending the review, which sought to write new rules for the rentals that some have said are a nuisance in neighborhoods dominated by single-family homes. Others have passionately defended the rentals, saying they fill an important need, draw revenue to the city and have been unfairly depicted by opponents.
The review has involved various city departments, including the auditor's office, and led to a number of heavily attended and sometimes highly charged public meetings with owners of rental homes, neighbors and other interested parties.
In June, the city's Board of Adjustment ruled that home rentals for a period of less than 10 days violate city code. That triggered a lawsuit by five owners of rental homes, who said that, if upheld, the ruling would deprive them of constitutionally protected property rights.
City officials deferred enforcement while the review played out, drawing the ire of short-term rental opponents.
Russ Horton, the plaintiffs' attorney, said Wednesday that they are not moving forward with the case as long as the city does not attempt to enforce the board's ruling.
Spelman said he can't remember a more contentious issue.
"Rather than to rush putting an ordinance in the books, let's see if we can find some incontrovertible evidence to see how many (short-term rentals) there are and what are the effects they're having on the neighborhoods, and get a sense of what problems we're trying to solve here," Spelman said.
"We've got neighborhoods that say, 'This is one of the worst things that's ever happened, it's tearing our neighborhoods apart, destroying our quality of life,' and saying these things need to be eliminated," Spelman said. "On the other hand, we've got owners, the Board of Realtors, HomeAway (the Austin-based vacation home listings giant) and others saying, 'These are really good for neighborhoods, and we are improving the quality of life, and we need to keep them and encourage them.'"
Spelman's proposal, which is co-sponsored by Council Member Chris Riley, is drawing mixed reaction, including criticism from council members Kathie Tovo and Laura Morris on at a council work session Tuesday.
Tovo questioned whether information gained from a new study would be more helpful than that already collected from "probably hundreds of stakeholders."
"The concern that's been raised is that people didn't buy their homes to live next door to a hotel," Morrison told the American-Statesman on Wednesday. "This is a policy decision that has far-reaching implications for the sustainability of our neighborhoods."
Maurice Anderson, who lives across the street from a short-term rental home in Allandale, questioned why Spelman would want to "freeze" the process.
"The city's Board of Adjustment ruled last year that commercial short-term rentals are illegal. Why didn't Councilman Spelman and the city stop their proliferation back then?" Anderson said in an email. "If Councilman Spelman wants to freeze something, that's what he should be freezing."
But one of the founders of the Austin Rental Alliance, which represents more than 100 owners of short-term rental homes, said Spelman is proposing the right approach.
"Let's look at the facts and the figures and let's get the emotion out of this. That's a fair way to do it," said Bob Easter, who with his wife owns two short-term rentals and who helped form the rental alliance last year.
Easter, one of the plaintiffs who appealed the Board of Adjustment's ruling, said he hoped a new study would also look at the renters themselves, a group he said includes grandparents visiting for special occasions and families who want to be with loved ones who are in Austin for extended medical treatments.
"They're not the party types that everyone is saying," Easter said.
Spelman's proposal would ask the city auditor to distinguish short-term rentals where the homeowner occupies the home from those where the homeowner does not live in the home. It asks the auditor to compile the numbers of 311 and 911 calls and police and code compliance citations issued at short-term rental locations in 2011 and compare results with the number and types of citations for the neighborhood in general.
This wouldn't be the first time the auditor has looked into short-term rentals. Last year, the auditor's office explored hotel occupancy taxes paid by short-term rental owners but didn't attempt to count all short-term rentals in the city, City Auditor Ken Mory said.
Spelman's resolution asks the auditor to update the 2011 study, which found evidence that some short-term rental properties had not been identified by the city controller's office and were not paying hotel occupancy taxes.
Easter said his alliance requires that members pay hotel occupancy taxes.
In a memo to the City Council on Wednesday, Mory estimated that the work Spelman's resolution seeks would take three months to complete and cost about $63,500.
The relatively fast rise of short-term or vacation rental homes as a business model appeared to catch city officials off guard in 2010.
The code amendment review began after the city Planning Commission noted a rising number of complaints about the rental homes from people who live near them.

The market may very well rally to the 5 or 14SMA on the daily, then find resistance.
The only thing that will ease the volatility and give equity markets a sustained and stable move from current levels is if clarity from the EU is given. IMO, I would like to see something drastic, maybe devalue the Euro or get the Euro-bond in place by the end of the year. At this point, I will take anything, even if it gives the markets a short-term shock, to get this crap out of the way.
Because I am expecting some level of 'shock' from the EU action that needs to get done, I will always have a small level of SPY protection in play.
Today we speak with German mezzo-soprano Daniela Sindram, who appears as Dulcinea in our Sunday/Friday cast for Don Quixote. Sindram previously appeared in Seattle as Cherubino in the 2009 production of The Marriage of Figaro, and we ask her what it's like to play "pants roles," as well as what she thinks about French opera and Dulcinea's character.
Last time you were in Seattle, you played a boy. This time, your character of Dulcinea is very much a woman! Do you prefer one type of role over the other?
I do not prefer one type of role over the other. But, in fact, I sing more pants roles than female parts, though the female parts are becoming more numerous, especially because my voice is developing more and more to the female Wagner parts. So I will sing my first Fricka (in Rheingold and Walk√ºre) this year and next year my first Venus in Tannh√§user. What parts I also really would LOVE to do are Italian parts like Santuzza (Cavalleria rusticana) or Eboli (Don Carlos). But still I love singing and playing boys and I have colossal fun on stage trying over and over again to make the audience forget that there is a woman only pretending to be a young man.
Daniela Sindram (seated in the center) as Cherubino in 2009's Marriage of Figaro. Also pictured, standing from left to right, is Christine Brandes as Susanna, Ted Schmitz as Basilio, and Mariusz Kwiecien as Count Almaviva.
You‚Äôve performed more Italian and German operas than French ones. What are the challenges specific to singing in French, as you do in Don Quixote?
For me, personally, the language itself is a big challenge because I never learned conversational French. That means much more preparation work for me, including how to pronounce and understand each word that you are singing and that others sing, so that you are able to interact. This process is way slower and more intense.
Nevertheless, I love the French language and singing in French. I think this language has something sensual and is easier to sing than, for instance, German. I also think the French music invites‚Äîeven demands‚Äîyou to connect your emotions directly with the music.
Nicolas Cavallier (Don Quixote) and Daniela Sindram (Dulcinea) in the Sunday/Friday cast of Don Quixote.
Is Dulcinea making the right choice by refusing Don Quixote? She says her destiny is to give her love away‚Äîwhat do you think of her outlook on life and romance?
Dulcinea finally comes to know Don Quixote as a noble and pure soul, and she realizes that she‚Äôs disclaimed a loveable man. But she also understands that she could never be even close to the ideal that Don Quixote formed in his dream world. So this seems to be the only choice she can make.
Her outlook on life and romance? I don‚Äôt think she believes that love can bring happiness, but maybe now that she knows Don Quixote she has a slight idea of what she‚Äôs really been yearning for and maybe it will open her up to real love‚Ä¶.
Here in America, there‚Äôs a stereotype of German productions as being very avant-garde. As someone who sings in Germany a lot, do you think this is true?
That's true. German productions are often avant-garde and unconventional. And sometimes you really can spend a very exciting and fantastic evening in the opera and see pieces from a different perspective. But it also often happens to me that I'm leaving a performance with a big question mark on my face, and I feel overstrained, trying to understand the deeper sense of that new interpretation. But there is a big audience in Germany that demands a new point of view from a director, though there‚Äôs also the audience that wants to see a recognizable piece (though maybe with modern staging). So we do have both there: modern and traditional productions.
Daniela Sindram (Dulcinea), with principal dancer Ra√∫l Salcedo, in Don Quixote.
Don Quixote premiered in 1910. Do you ever get the opportunity to perform music even newer than that?
Oh, yes, I regularly do ‚Äúnew‚Äùmusic. Last November I did a production of The Turn of the Screw by Britten (first performed 1954). In the last few years I also sang the part of Sophie in Sophie's Choice by Nicholas Maw which was performed in 2002 for the first time. I also did a piece‚ÄîDeutsches St√ºck mit Hamlet from 1998‚Äîcomposed by Wolfgang Rihm, a living German composer. I had the opportunity to meet Nicholas Maw and Wolfgang Rihm in person, but I‚Äôve never had the chance to meet a composer while working on a piece, or to create a new role, which I would love to do. I recently started singing modern songs from different composers and right now I have some unpublished songs from Detlev Glanert (also a living German composer) that I'm looking forward to performing in the future.

Making So isn‚Äôt something to be dismissed ‚Äî the choice is critical to your site‚Äôs achievement, though. After allyour website‚Äôs theme will decide the design displayed to your customers, and your plugins will include most of its plugins.
To help You make an educated decision, I will be taking an in-depth look at a few of the top places to purchase WordPress plugins and themes: MyThemeShop. As well as analyzing MyThemeShop in general, I‚Äôll also be looking in its most important features, reviewing some of its top products and sharing hints for prospective buyers.
Using a Title like MyThemeShop, you‚Äôd think the answer would be clear cut. In fact, MyThemeShop occupies a middle ground between a WordPress theme store and a WordPress‚Äôbar‚Äô. Because of its pricing policy, more leans .
This is Because although all of its products (MyThemeShop develops themes and plugins) are readily available to purchase individually, it also includes a membership option that gives users complete access to its whole product range.
As we have Touched during this post, MyThemeShop offers quality, 24/7 support for many of its customers. So that other users may learn from issues, it takes place primarily in its own support forum.
There is a Dedicated section for themes and plugins, plus separation between superior and free products. Simply post your problem about the forum and one of the MyThemeShop-employed service staff will respond typically .
Rather Than focusing on paid associates, MyThemeShop delivers great support to free users as well, believing that the service someone receives for a commodity shouldn‚Äôt rely on whether they paid or not.
The forum Additionally supports a search function, which means that you may look to a problem the fastest way to discover answers. Inquiries that were resolved are indicated with a postage that was green solved.
Along with The service forum, MyThemeShop has added a collection of 45 video tutorials teaching the basics of WordPress, how to use the MyThemeShop goods, as well as how to use some favorite non-MyThemeShop plugins. These videos are accessible via the Tutorial tab.
And, if You‚Äôre still not able after posting to the support forum to fix your issue, MyThemeShop also provides support. Should you require tweaks to your theme, specific customisations, website setup, or website migrations, the MyThemeShop support team will be able to assist you out (though these services are, as you would expect, paid).
Now, on To the important stuff: its products‚Äô quality and choice. We‚Äôll begin by studying MyThemeShop‚Äôs core product range: WordPress themes.
MyThemeShop Themes were created with usability in mind, and each motif ships using a market-leading motif options panel from which you are able to control the theme‚Äôs settings, import arbitrary content (to get your website looking like the demo you watched when you purchased the motif ), or dip into its many customisation choices.
For a Begin, each motif has support for colors that are unlimited and the entire catalog of Google net fonts ‚Äî over 600. Maybe more importantly, all themes offer unlimited background options: such as a variety of built-in background layouts, the aforementioned unlimited colors, and also the option to upload a custom background image.
The Themes are fairly feature-rich too. There‚Äôs built in advertising management, buttons that were stylish and lightweight, and contact form performance included with each theme. All topics come with support for the entire selection of MyThemeShop shortcodes, letting you incorporate eye-catching design elements to your website easily.
Most Importantly, though, is that this is a clean, lightweight, and robust code underneath all. What‚Äôs more, to ensure that your website is as visitor-friendly as you possibly can, all topics boast a fully mobile responsive layout, lightning-quick load times, and cross-browser compatibility.
Another Bonus: each theme has a narrated video tutorial, also MyThemeShop offers round-the-clock support that will assist you out of any tight spots you might experience (more about this later).
All Themes include a preview to help you get an concept of the plan. These previews come in rows of three by default, but, if you‚Äôd like a slightly larger preview, you can pick rows of two. There‚Äôs also a filter which allows you form the themes by popularity or release date.
When You have found a motif you like the appearance of, you could click through to the motif‚Äôs product page. Here, you are going to be able to read more about the theme‚Äôs main attributes, plus you will find an notion of the subject‚Äôs popularity ‚Äî every theme includes a community rating from five.
Before You buy a theme, I would strongly recommend spending a few minutes researching this demonstration. You‚Äôll be able to sample the motif‚Äôs layouts, try out different customisation options, and find a general idea of how the theme looks and performs.
From Social media to the search engines, Schema is a site tailored for dominating the SERPs ‚Äî achieved by a carefully designed, SEO-optimized layout. The subject is also fast, with website speed an important ranking element. The website uses a stylish-yet-simple layout, also it comes packaged with inspection performance and advertising management. For an SEO-focused theme named Schema, the motif, of course, adds the necessary Schema markup which powers Google wealthy snippets.
Social Traffic is consistently growing, and sites have popped up feeding off societal traffic. If you are searching to construct a viral social website, SociallyViral was built for you ‚Äî that the motif boasts many different features to Boost social shares and also cater to viral traffic. That means a site with a great deal of societal buttons, trending article widgets, and, with one eye on monetization, advanced AdSense optimization.
OnePage supports a stunning full-screen slider over The fold, catching traffic‚Äô attentions immediately. It‚Äôs largely a company theme, supporting dedicated staff, portfolio, customer, testimonials, and pricing segments ‚Äî all of which look extremely professional and extend trendy parallax effects. The theme also looks great when kitted out in its alternative blogging skin.
PointPro is just another stylish, professional motif, this Time coming in three variations ‚Äî shop, blog, and business. The company template is particularly eye-catching, using a tidy, organized layout complementing lots of pictures ‚Äî there is an image slider, thumbnails, and gallery functionality, too. The motif gives you loads of versatility, with wallpapers that are unlimited colors, and custom sidebars.
You can Search for plugins in precisely the same way as topics, however, because plugins vary in regard to their capabilities, the plugin pages are the areas.
Each Plugin page has a very long list of the plugin‚Äôs features, providing you with a clear indication of what it can (or can not ) do. You will also see a user evaluation, and there is a useful presentation for every plugin so you can see each one in action.
Since There are fewer plugins compared to themes, let‚Äôs run down the three MyThemeShop WordPress plugins. I supply a succinct summary of what each plugin can do.
WP Mega Menus adds beautiful, interactive menus into your website. The menus that are mega arrive allow you to add images, and packed with choices. These menus are a prominent and stunning design feature for your site, plus they make it simple to navigate.
WP Subscribe Pro enables you to exhibit stylish popups and Subscription boxes to cultivate your list. This plugin boasts lots of design options to play , and support for exit intent technology. You can even incorporate WP Subscribe Pro such as MailChimp, AWeber and, needless to say, together with the email marketing autoresponder services.
MyThemeShop Functions a flat pricing structure ‚Äî any theme will set you back a predetermined $59, with plugins. This is a typical price for plugins and themes, and on a par with major marketplaces like CodeCanyon and ThemeForest.
Should you Want access an membership account costs $167 annually. You‚Äôll get access to client support and 20 plugins, as well as most of 99 themes and full access.
Membership Is more expensive than that of some of the other motif clubs, like ElegantThemes (from $59 a year), TeslaThemes (from $59 a year), and ThemeIsle (from $99 a year), but more affordable than the likes of WooThemes (from $399 a year ‚Äî update ‚Äî 16th July: WooThemes.com is currently under the umbrella of WooCommerce.com, with their themes available at https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/), WPMU Dev (from $294 a year), and StudioPress (from $499 annually ).
What is More, an membership will also give you access to some products released by MyThemeShop to the length of your subscription.
Overall, MyThemeShop is among the WordPress clubs round ‚Äî it delivers an impressive range. Throw in an excellent, flexible selection of plugins and support that is ongoing, and it is not hard to see why more than 300,000 customers have taken the plunge and become MyThemeShop customers.
Should you Construct lots of sites ‚Äî perhaps as a creative service or a freelance programmer ‚Äî then the club membership is sure to be the most appealing option. This package will give you access to impress your customers, and each one comes loaded with customisation options so you can tailor a site to a client‚Äôs liking.
The Yearly membership reflects the best value, and more than holds its own when compared for 20 specialist plugins and 99 quality topics is an absolute steal!
I‚Äôve been wanting to share this shoot for so long, because it‚Äôs such a fond memory and also because I just ADORE the images from it.
So last year, I spent the day with Dominique Bader Photography, creating a simple dinner party set up for her guests that evening. We made mince pies, had a glorious cake from The Floury and a lot of fun. AND right now I‚Äôm here to give you a few tips on designing your winter table but if you‚Äôd like further tips on having a stress-free Christmas then head on over to Rock My Style for our feature. You‚Äôll also read below my simple mince pie recipe which I follow yearly. It‚Äôs not only something I love to do as it gets me in the spirit but it‚Äôs also RIDICULOUSLY easy.
1 | When you want to put together a quick dinner party styling for winter time, foliage is your friend. Things like ivy or branches you can forage from your own garden or local forest are great options. Make sure you don‚Äôt steal from someones home if you don‚Äôt know them!! OR pop to a flower shop and pick up a few stems of something branch like to lay along the table. There‚Äôll be a lot of twig like options right now. Try and stay away from anything glittery!
2 | Declutter. The key to a table lay is it being functional and intentional in it‚Äôs beauty. The table is set for people to sit at, drink, eat and chat at. You don‚Äôt want too many fussy items that can be knocked over or detract from the function of the dinner party. Simple is always best.
3 | Add candle light! With our shorter days you‚Äôll most likely be dining in the darker hours. You can buy beautiful frosted pillar candles to add texture and beautiful lighting to your table. The candles sit beautifully in-between branches laid through the centre, they also take a while to burn so you won‚Äôt need to worry about them running out if dinner goes on for a bit longer as well as you can use them over and over again!
4 | A fabric runner adds movement and softness to a table design. It also gives context to the design of the centre of the table. Even if you want to have a table cloth, consider a simple piece of fabric to bring attention to the centre.
5 | Your normal crockery will be perfect, don‚Äôt worry about fancy plates. Consider laying your larger plates down to act as a charger for the rest of your meals.
7 | Consider adding a scented candle to add to the evenings senses. Neom are great for truly perfuming a space!
A great online shop to purchase beautiful decor items. I love their pillar and shaped candles which work great for a dinner party. Don‚Äôt forget some glass plates to catch any melting wax.
I love adding coasters under water glasses, it might sound silly but I feel it gives the glass grounding and adds to a table setting. A considered thought has gone into using a beautiful marble coaster. These coasters are my favourite and always used at dinner parties. They work for any style of event and work through spring, summer right until winter.
Pop on down to your local fabric shop to get a cut of around 3m of a chiffon or crepe to use for your table. It‚Äôs a quick an cheap alternative to buying a linen however it will have it‚Äôs raw cut edges, something to note! Or if you want to invest in something totally special and to be used multiple times, I recommend a gorgeous cotton runner from Kate Cullen, a stunning choice and she has hand-dyed to the most perfect shades.
This place offers up beautiful and inexpensive options for cake stands and display platters for your food.
1. You want to place the flour and butter together in a bowl and rub together to create a crumb consistency. Then add the sugar and 1 egg and mix together to make a sticky dough.
2. Tip the ingredients out onto a lightly floured surface and fold until it comes together to create a firm dough. Wrap it in cling film and pop in the fridge to cool for about 10minutes.
Pop your oven on to 220C/200C for fan assisted ovens or Gas 7.
4. Roll out your pastry to 3mm thickness and begin cutting the shapes. I use a textured round cutter to create the base, usually with a scalloped edge. You should be able to cut around 12 with left over pastry.
5. Remember to grease your cupcake tin then pop your circular pastry bases in, pressing lightly. Tablespoon your mincemeat into the base and brush the edges with your whisked egg.
7. Bake your mince pies for 15 to 20minutes ‚Äì I usually find 15minutes is enough! then take them out to cool before picking them out of the tray.
8. Finally dust with icing sugar!
The moment I realised I loved teaching was the minute I began speaking at my very first Instashoot workshop at Tanya‚Äôs Cafe in London. I had a small group of 9 small businesses from all walks of life sit around a table together, amongst gorgeous flowers, their flower cat ears in place all ready to work through the exercise book I‚Äôd poured all of my learnings into. That adrenaline kicked in and I felt energised and joyful discussing Instagram with these peers and inspiring women sat around me.
After a year of successful workshops I began receiving emails on how other solo-preneurs were too far to attend and sad to miss out on the in-person teachings. I didn‚Äôt initially consider writing an online course because of the beauty of in-person teaching, I‚Äôm a sponge, i love to soak up energy and talk to my students. I wanted to hear their stories, talk through their struggles and truly connect with them however my writing bug got the better of me this year and I decided to try my hand at writing some of what I taught.
I did worry that if I wrote an online course it would eliminate the beauty of my in-person workshops but over time as my workshops have developed I‚Äôve realised they, too, have become more than there were originally set out to do. At my latest one at Millbridge Court, I made the decision that all future workshops will only have a maximum of 6 students, reducing from my original class size of 10. The reason behind that is to get more talking happen, get more community spirit building and so I have even MORE time individually with each student rather than darting around at the end to try and have in-depth conversations with everyone.
At my workshops, I made friends, I cried and I spoke so honestly about my own growth that the room felt like a space of friends rather than industry peers. I am so honoured to have taught intimately over 40 students since beginning the workshops and hope to continue to do so many more, however I‚Äôm hoping that this online course is going to offer up the same warmth that my in-person students receive. I truly spoke from the heart in this course.
One thing you may have already figured out about me, I absolutely adore writing. From instagram to fictional stories, I have such a passion for putting pen to paper (or finger tips to screen) and scribbling away all my thoughts, words and dreams. Whilst I‚Äôm not the best at language and I make a whole load of spelling errors, I adore this way of communicating with my audience and even in my workshops. That is how I developed the Instashoot Workbook.
When I began to write my teachings for this online course, the words seemed to just happen, whilst I had a stressful time figuring out the entire structure (I‚Äôm a perfectionist and want everything completed yesterday), I soon began to feel that this course was much more than just Instagram styling but a story of my businesses growth, how I gained my following, how I grew my client book, why I did what I did back then and where work takes me now. Never had I looked at my timeline of my story before but I‚Äôve put it out there for you in this course, so you can literally see, step by step, how I came to where I am now.
Whilst I‚Äôm no millionaire (and have no ambition to be) I am the happiest I have ever been when I first decided after university that I wanted to work within weddings. I found my calling finally and found my voice.
Now, let me do the same for you. I‚Äôd love you to read more about the course, what is included and all the details you‚Äôll want to know.

Optometry has to take the lead with glaucoma, especially with recent advancements.
1. Diagnose it sooner. With new OCT modalities, we can diagnose the disease sooner than ever and begin treatment earlier. However, ODs must use this technology with caution and be sure to have a firm grasp on the data provided. We have to understand what we are looking at with the deceptively simple red, yellow and green charts to avoid over- or under-diagnosing glaucoma.
Other new diagnostics can help as well. Corneal hysteresis may predict visual field loss progression and can play a role in deciding when to treat and in setting treatment expectations. And someday, 24-hour home monitoring of IOP may completely transform our management strategies.
2. Understand the disease better. While we don‚Äôt fully understand what causes glaucoma, we know IOP is a risk factor, as is corneal thickness and hysteresis, family history, age, race, high myopia, systemic conditions, previous trauma and chronic inflammation. Knowing the cause will one day allow us to treat the disease more effectively. One theory suggests it‚Äôs caused by an imbalance between IOP inside the eye and intracranial pressure (ICP) around the optic nerve, affecting the eye‚Äôs metabolic needs.1 For example, patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension have a bowing of their optic nerve, and 50% of astronauts develop vision loss because their cerebral spinal fluid increases disproportionately higher than their IOP, resulting in a hyperopic shift and optic nerve edema.1 So the key ratio may be IOP minus ICP‚Äînot just elevated IOP.
3. Rethink surgery. The introduction of minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS) has forever changed glaucoma treatment. We must be ready to help manage patient compliance, understand the options for those on maximum therapy and properly educate and refer patients with both glaucoma and cataracts. Invasive surgeries such as trabeculectomy will go by the wayside, making room for a greater combination of MIGS, laser procedures such as SLT, and next-generation pharmaceuticals.
5. Treat the ocular surface. Optometrists can‚Äôt forget the impact of glaucoma therapies on the ocular surface. Staining, blurred vision, irritation or dryness from chronic meds can cause patients to decrease or even discontinue their use. Something as simple as managing the ocular surface may improve compliance and, ultimately, outcomes.
Glaucoma is a condition that affects all of our practices, and these five elements may well dictate the future of disease management, our understanding and innovations in patient care.

Can someone please help me out on this. We are doing a POC of the new Ifolder 3.8 server and 3.8 client to replace the older Ifolder. One thing that we have seen is that client on a machine would just at some point will stop uploading files. I have machine A B and C. On machine C, if I create a new file, Ifolder would not recognize that there was file that was created and in turn never upload it to the server. While this is happening on machine C, I could go to Machine A, create a new file it would upload the file to the server and machine B and interestingly Machine C would also download the file and sync it with the server. Machine C will still never upload that file I created before. Exiting and restarting Ifolder would solve the issue. Anyone out there seen this?

1. Set up your green screen background for your videos. You can use a professional green screen, a Party City or similar green tablecloth, green bulletin board paper, a green sheet or a pizza box tabletop green screen with green Starbucks straws to support small props. Be creative and experiment with color and lighting to get the best possible video.
2. Record your videos with the green screen as a background using your basic iPad camera app. If you are creating multiple projects at the same time you may want to set up multiple albums in your photo app. One album for each project will help keep you organized. When ALL of the videos have been recorded, it is time for the third step.
3. Choose your background photo or video. You can use the iPad camera app to take a background photo or video or import a picture from the internet. Imagine the possibilities: outer space, maps, historical places, under the sea, gardens, national landmarks, etc.
4. Open up the Do Ink app and look for the import areas at the bottom of the screen. Add your background photo or video to the bottom row. Add your first video to the middle row. After adding the first video, slide it over to allow the second video to be added (use the red line as a guide). Go ahead and follow that process, adding and sliding, until all of your videos have been imported on the same line. Watch this tutorial for further instruction.
5. Save your video to the camera roll, and then email it or upload it to YouTube, Facebook, or Vimeo. Then hare the link on Twitter or email to parents.
For Kindergarten, I read the book Leaf Man and had the kids design their own leaf man. They wrote one sentence to tell the direction their leaf will fly (north, south, east, or west) and what it will fly over (a house, school, field, bridge, or something similar). I then used the pizza box table-top green screen with green Starbucks straws to complete this project. I simply taped their leaf to the green straw and the kids took over, reading their sentence and making their leaf dance across the green screen. After I added a background video of a small creek, their leaves then danced above the creek!
First Graders read the book, The Great Kapok Tree. The kids chose an animal from the story, conducted research on PebbleGo and wrote one or two favorite facts. I printed small versions of their animals and used a table-top green screen (pizza box) and green Starbucks straws. Each child read their facts while moving their animal around using the green straw. I used the green screen app to add the kapok tree as the background.
Second graders created commercials for their economics unit, advertising a specific good or service. They worked together to write a script, and we used green screen technology to put them into an actual location.
Third graders became meteorologists. Each student chose a location in the world using this website. They researched the weather, wrote a script and became a meteorologist for the day. I recorded each child in front of the green screen and used the Do Ink app to add different backgrounds for each child. The kids loved watching each other report the weather in their actual places.
See some of these projects here.

What 'wounded warriors' need to know about securing disability benefits | Alverson + O'Brien, P.C.
It‚Äôs extremely important for those brave men and women who suffered some manner of disabling injury while serving in our nation‚Äôs armed forces to understand that they may be entitled to more than just the benefits available through the Department of Veterans Affairs. Indeed, they may also be able to secure benefits via the Social Security Disability Insurance program.
The SSDI program is structured in such a manner that these ‚Äúwounded warriors‚Äù can receive expedited processing of their disability claims from Social Security Administration staff.
As to which armed forces personnel are eligible for this expedited processing, the SSA offers it to any service member who became disabled while on active duty anytime on or after October 1, 2001, irrespective of location.
The medical condition must have lasted or be expected to last for a minimum of one year, or result in death.
One question that service members inevitably have is whether they are able to receive benefits for a prior disability if their health has since improved.
The good news is that receiving disability benefits for a closed period is a possibility.
However, the determination as to whether the service member qualifies for a closed period of disability is contingent upon whether the medical condition meets the SSA‚Äôs disability definition, whether it was filed within a designated window and several other factors.
We‚Äôll examine these factors in our next post.
Regardless of whether you served in the military, if you have questions about disability benefits, please consider speaking with an experienced legal professional as soon as possible.

Suppression of renin and aldosterone by small amounts of DOCA in normal man.
Previous investigators have suggested that low renin hypertension may be due to an unknown mineralocorticoid. This investigation was designed to simulate the effect of an unknown mineralocorticoid by administration of small amounts of desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) in three normal subjects. The response of 2-h upright plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PA), and urinary aldosterone excretion (UA), as well as extracellular fluid volume, (ECFV) was determined on a high and low salt diet before and during the administration of DOCA for 13 days. After 9 days of DOCA, ECFV increased approximately 2 liters and PRA decreased to levels found in our patients with LRH. PA and UA decreased appropriately as PRA was suppressed. We would expect an unknown mineralocorticoid to have similar effects on the reninangiotension-aldosterone system. Thus, these results would suggest that in LRH the normal levels of PA and UA are inappropriately elevated in relation to the low PRA.
The campaign designated funds to the center to enhance the services provided.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, CA ‚Äì November 9, 2017 ‚Äì French Hospital Medical Center (FHMC), a Dignity Health Central Coast hospital, is pleased to announce the collaboration with the Grover Beach Police Department, the Grover Beach Police Officers‚Äô Association, and Cuesta College Safety Services to raise funds for FHMC‚Äôs Hearst Cancer Resource Center. The Pink Patch Project, a collaborative cancer awareness campaign originally conceptualized in Los Angeles, raised a total of $8,075 during the first annual fundraiser in October.
Each organization sold commemorative pink patches for $10 each to their respective officers, to be worn on the arm of their uniforms during the month of October, which is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The partnership was initiated to raise funds for the Hearst Cancer Resource Center, which will help further the research, treatment and care of those battling cancer and their family members.
The Pink Patch Project generates awareness about breast cancer, the most common cancer and the second leading cause of death for women in the United States. While most people are aware of breast cancer, this campaign educates the public about the early detection and prevention of cancer. The collective efforts of public safety agencies throughout the nation through these efforts yielded a tremendous amount of support from many communities.
The Hearst Cancer Resource Center wellness and support services provide a bridge between standard medical care and a full range of healing therapies. The integrative approach offers a foundation for care that includes an array of programs designed to strengthen the body, educate the mind, and alleviate the stress which often comes with a cancer diagnosis.

Anesthesia and analgesia for labor.
Epidural analgesia remains the mainstay for providing pain relief during labor. The search continues to find the ideal combination of analgesic agents and administration techniques that will provide excellent pain relief for the mother yet minimize side effects to the mother and fetus. This article reviews recent studies of epidural analgesia, including the increased use of epidural opioids, patient-controlled epidural analgesia, and the complications of epidural analgesia (including effects on gastric emptying, maternal temperature control, and hemodynamic changes to the mother and fetus). Intrathecal (spinal) analgesia, especially using opioids, is also discussed.

We are excited that we will be traveling to Prichard, Alabama, again this summer! This will be our seventh year serving with Light of the Village at their summer Bible camps. Camp activities include Bible study, games, music, sports, skits, crafts and more, but the real highlight is investing in and developing relationships with the children Light of the Village serves. This trip is an incredible opportunity for our students to see God at work and to take part in His mission by serving and loving His people. We spend our days in Alabama serving; then at night we come together for a daily recap, worship and a time of devotion.
Sunday, June 16, we will attend the 9:15 BP service and the beginning of the 11 o‚Äôclock service, then head for ‚ÄòBama after a quick lunch that is provided. We will travel to Prichard in a charter bus. Time spent traveling is sometimes when the greatest bonds are formed as a team. We‚Äôll stop in Tallahassee for dinner and arrive at Government Street Baptist Church in Mobile around 9 p.m. We will arrive back in Tampa the evening of Saturday, June 22.
If you are interested in going, please email Sharon@stfchurch.com for an application. The application will be reviewed by our Student Ministry Team, and you should hear back from them no later than 1 week after you submit your application.
of the farmers from Ukkalgaon village of Shrirampur block. By analyzing the problem and reasons behind it, the KVK made an effort by providing a suitable solution of rakshak traps for effective management of fruit flies in water melon. Rakshak traps are the pheromone traps which are useful for mass trapping of the male adults of fruit flies. By installing three rakshak traps per acre immediately after fruit setting can effectively manage fruit fly infestation in water melon.Initially KVK undertook the awareness programmes in the form of trainings and group discussion regarding effective management of pests and diseases in water melon and major focus was given towards fruit fly management. The farmers were made aware of rakshak traps as an effective tool for ontrolling fruit flies in water melon. For popularizing this concept among the farmers, the KVK undertook the frontline demonstration on use of rakshak traps against fruit flies at 30 different locations in Ukkalgaon village.
The farmers were asked to install 3 rakshak traps per acre after one month of crop growth stage and change the Bacu lure after 30 days. These traps help in mass trapping of male fruit flies and thereby minimize it‚Äôs population in the field. The method demonstration on installation of rakshak trap and placing of Bacu lure in this trap was also conducted on the field. The farmers were asked to take daily observations about the catches obtained in these traps up to one week.
KVK supported this technology through supply of rakshak traps and Bacu lures from KVK farmer‚Äôs service center and thus it helped in spreading of this technology in different parts of the district. Thus the timely and quality supply of this input at reasonable rate has also resulted in increasing the adoption of this technology.
With the participation of the farmers the group action took place in Ukkalgaon village for installation of rakshak traps with Bacu lures because there was considerable area under water melon with polythene mulch. The large number of catches of male fruit flies was observed during first 5-6 days and after that the catches were minimized.. This resulted in less egg laying of the pest and thus the incidence of the pest was under check. It helped to convince the water melon growers regarding the efficacy of rakshak traps for fruit fly management.
The efforts made by KVK in this direction resulted in wide spread adoption of the technology. The technology also spread in the neighboring villages and more number of farmers started to approach KVK for supply of these traps. By observing the effectiveness of rakshak traps, some of the vegetable and fruit growers in the district purchased these traps in bulk quantities from the service center of the KVK and started to use it against fruit flies in cucurbits as well as fruit crops. More than 3000 rakshak traps have been supplied by the KVK through it‚Äôs farmer‚Äôs service center and the technology has been adopted by more than 200 vegetable and fruit growers in the district covering 325 ha. area during last two years. The concept has now become the regular practice among all the water melon and musk melon growers from the KVK operational areas. By seeing this result, State Agricultural Department also conducted the block demonstration of rakshak traps in water melon on large scale under the funds of ATMA.
Driving shouldn‚Äôt be taking lightly. Not only are you responsible for your own life on the road, but also supposed to look out for pedestrians and fellow drivers as a good citizen. If you do not give your complete attention to your steering wheel, there is a chance that you might cause accidents on the road that can end disastrously for you.
In Australia, drivers tend to be distracted by other matters when they are on the road. They divide their attention between the steering wheel and everything else which places them in imminent danger without them realising it. A landmark study was carried out with the help of in-car footage to understand this situation. The footage was captured over thousands of trips after a group of motorists agreed to become a part of the study.
The findings left the researchers worried about the condition of roads. One of the participants in the study was Ann Williamson who is a road-safety analyst. She volunteered to make a contribution and let her driving habits to be captured on camera.
She was taken aback by the results. According to her, many things end up becoming obstacles to driving if one thinks about it.
Monash University, located in Melbourne, began the interesting study through their Accident Research Centre. The drivers were filmed for almost 2 million kilometres throughout the study.
Professor Jude Charlton, who is the head of the centre, found that a large number of drivers find it difficult actually to focus on the road ahead when driving. They spend 45% of their time behind the wheel doing unrelated things. That means that they engage in a secondary activity after every 93 seconds of driving.
How are drivers distracted? Moreover, what can be done about it?
Whenever one thinks of distractions when driving, the first thing that comes to mind is the use of mobile phones. However, it turns out there are other activities too which can cause drivers to take their eyes off the road. They are unable to concentrate on driving when they are taking a bite, adjusting dashboard controls, touching up their appearance or engaging in conversation with other people in the car.
The diversity of activities is a cause of concern because people do not realise that these small things add up to a massive distraction overall. Drivers do not even understand that they are unfocused, and that is when the worst of accidents take place.
According to Professor Williamson, drivers need to figure out their priorities before they can drive a vehicle on a public road. It is not impossible for them to do two tasks at a time, but the main emphasis should be on driving carefully.
The analysis of distractions when driving was an offshoot of a massive study of in-car behaviour that is ongoing. Professor Raphael Grzebieta, a chief investigator for the Australian Naturalistic Driving Study, states that they want to study Australian drivers in different conditions.

I love this sauce! It is good on just about everything. My favorite is on tacos, on Taco Night.
New product for us - very good.
I was an early adopter of this FABULOUS hot sauce. The hot version (not mild or extra hot) is our go to hot sauce. It is great with fish and chicken and has a unique savory quality. It's not overly salty like some hot sauces, and adds to almost anything you could want to spice up. I use it a lot in cooking to just give some warmth and flavor to any number of dishes.
Easily one of my favorite hot sauces.
Tis the best, great product, service, will try more soon!
It is not very spicy for my tastes, but does have a little amount of bite that comes slowly. It is a sauce and would be great on tacos or something where you want a less thick sauce. Very neat taste- will buy again!
This is perfect with Salmon. It is like it was made it. It is also very good with eggs. It ry to keep a couple bottles on hand.
This stuff is great with chicken. If you want something quick, grill some slices of chicken in a little olive oil, brown, take off the heat and pour in the peri peri. Don't inhale..! Mmmmm Good Stuff!
Something about the Peri Peri sauce is so tasty, I'm glad I was able to find it in a three pack! I'm sure it will be used up soon!
I have been into hot sauces my entire life.The 3 Peri Peri sauces from South Africa are my all-time favorite.Great flavor and 3 seperate heat levels to choose from! I highly recommend everyone try them!
Has decent flavor but majorly lacks heat. Had to use quite a bit to get the desired flavor. It is actually about as hot as tabasco sauce.
I'd recommend the hotter version of this sauce. The mild is too bland.

African Rhino Peri-Peri Hot Sauce is tasty. The "hot" version has as much flavor as it has burn. great with burritos. Good, civilized heat for a meal.

I've decided what I want to be when I grow up. A stay-at-home-crafter. It's all I've been able to think about since this summer. There are too many things I want to make or attempt to make, and there isn't any time to do it in! To make this idea more appealing to Tom, I threw in the idea of also growing all of our own veggies and made the mistake of saying, "I'll even milk goats." In case you don't know Tom too well, he has a dream about living in the country somewhere on a goat farm. While he's not milking his goats, he'll be at our road-side-veggie-stand selling our homemade jellies, veggies, and crafts that our 12 kids made, under my supervision of course.
Washing water in which the washing cloth has been boiled. Dilute with equal parts cold water before using.You could also use one of the several brand of sanitary wipes.
Maybe. Just maybe one day I can be a stay-at-home crafter-mom-veggie-gardener-goat-milker.
Everyday when my students walk into class they have some sort of a journal or sentences to correct. Today the sentence was about how ice cream was patented by Italo Marchiony in 1903.
Well, the student came in and said, "Did that guy really patent ice cream?"
Me: "yes, I believe he did."
This made me laugh so hard! My husband and I have been tinkering with the idea of moving a few miles away to have land for gardening, tree climbing, and a bit of free-range roaming. We have a child at a Waldorf school (very organic) and have several friends who have their own chickens, goats, gardens, etc. But then I think of the work involved in gardening and goat-milking...I feel tired and go take a nap.
I would like to share an article written by a recent guest on my show, Terry Beatley who is the founder of No Excuse Ministry PAC.
This is in response to the letter to the editor of the Freelance Star Newspaper, with the title ‚ÄúThink you have control over your own body, ladies?‚Äù [Feb. 6]. I would like to share a counterpoint from Dr. Bernard Nathanson, co-founder of NARAL, America‚Äôs largest abortion lobby group. On Dec. 1, 2009, I flew to New York to interview Dr. Nathanson, who felt personally responsible for killing 75,000 children while he advanced unfettered abortion in the 1970s, and gave me a message to carry to America. I promised him I would carry his message and never stop.
The author of the letter, asked: ‚ÄúHow is forcing [a pregnant woman] to carry a baby to term with a serious deformity going to help anyone?‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo you think you have autonomy over your own body?‚Äù She voiced her complaint that Del. Mark Cole was patron of a bill that would repeal taxpayer funding of the state‚Äôs Medicaid program for women who choose to kill their babies in the womb due to physical deformity or mental deficiency. The author saw nothing positive or good in bringing a baby like this to full-term.
Dr. Nathanson had answers to these questions; if I could share them with the author over a cup of coffee, this is what I would say.
As I entered Dr. Nathanson‚Äôs apartment that December day, I observed a feeble man in his 80s. Too shaky to stand to his feet, he welcomed me to sit beside him while I asked my questions. I listened intently, sometimes with tears in my eyes, as his story unfolded. His decisions affected the course of American history and the lives of millions of Americans.
In 1969, with the help of a public relations firm, Dr. Nathanson and a few other people caught the nation by surprise and framed the debate over legalizing‚Äìor, rather, decriminalizing‚Äìabortion. The co-founders of NARAL invented the slogans of ‚Äúfreedom of choice‚Äù and ‚Äúwomen must have control over their own bodies.‚Äù Framing the debate away from the morality‚Äìor immorality‚Äìof killing another person, he and his team set out on a course to change public opinion and lay the groundwork for Roe v. Wade.
To gain the public‚Äôs acceptance of decriminalized abortion, he and his colleagues fabricated poll results, making it appear that the majority of Americans wanted legalized abortion, and disseminated this information to the media. In addition, they lied about the number of illegal abortions performed annually in the U.S., consistently citing 1 million abortions a year when only about 100,000 were being performed.
The co-founder of NARAL also explained how they marketed the idea that legalizing abortion would not increase the overall number of abortions‚Äìa claim that is now preposterous considering that a million people a year lose their lives to abortion. Reflecting on the sinister nature of the death industry, it was obvious he was remorseful for partaking in this national deception.
Four years after co-founding the nation‚Äôs largest pro-abortion lobby group, Dr. Nathanson saw the error of his ways and became pro-life. With the help of the new and improved ultrasound and electronic fetal heart monitoring, a second patient was revealed: a baby, a baby with a beating heart, puckering his lips, stretching his little arms.
Shattering his pro-abortion world, founded on lies and deception, Dr. Nathanson turned from being pro-abortion and began to tell the truth. He even made an in-utero film called ‚ÄúSilent Scream,‚Äù which shows an abortion taking place. Revealing a baby squirming away from the suction tube, a little mouth open in an inaudible cry, ‚ÄúSilent Scream‚Äù was seen and ‚Äúheard‚Äù around the country.
Dr. Nathanson knew what we all really know in our hearts: The baby is not the woman‚Äôs body. Therein is the lie that the co-founder of NARAL started. Once we recognize the humanity of the baby, who temporarily lives inside his mother, the argument, not the baby, is dead. Regardless of how deformed or ugly, he or she has the gift of life, and every life is precious. No child‚Äôs life should be taken. A woman can do what she wants with her body, but the baby living inside her is a separate and genetically distinct human being with every right to live.
When a nation and a government violate this principle of life, everyone‚Äôs rights are abrogated. The same lie supported slavery; the same lie undergirded the Holocaust the notion that someone is less than human.
As his hands trembled while reaching for a cup of water, I was thankful that since 1973 his life had been put to good use, proclaiming a message of life and love, not death and deception. He died on Feb. 21, 2011, but his message will never stop. Loving babies and protecting the gift of life, no matter how short or difficult, are the right things to do.
When America can do that again, everyone‚Äôs right to life is protected and the ‚Äúworth‚Äù of someone‚Äôs life will never be measured by somebody else‚Äôs scale. This protects the individual‚Äôs right to life and benefits society as a whole.
D.F. ‚Äì Thanks for sharing your comments. Experience can change a person‚Äôs view on life and it‚Äôs choices. Sometimes you wake up and realize the truth, not everyone is weak minded and easily ‚Äúduped‚Äù. I thought abortion was fine until after having several the concequences caught up with me. No one told me it was wrong, it was my own guilt and remorse that did so. It took me years to heal. some women never reach healing and spend years in depression and torment over their abortion choice. Today, there are so many other options ‚Äì there are so many wonderful families waiting to love and nurture a child and it isnt as difficult to be a birth mother.
How can you say ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt difficult being a birth mother‚Äù? What if you are 12 years old and your stepfather has sexually abused you? What if your life is in danger and giving birth could kill you and the baby? What if you have no money, no job, and children who need you right now?
Maybe I should have said that it isnt as difficult now, compared to 30 years ago, being a birth mother. Many agencies will assist you with medical and practical needs if you decide on adoption. Life is life and all is valuable to me ‚Äì Look at Steve Jobs, he was adopted, Tim Tebow was supposed to be aborted for health reasons. God is in control of the universe, he is the giver of life. Many of my friends have children with handicaps, one so severe that she was cofined to bed for most of her life, but her existence formed a family built around support and service to others.
This story reminds me of some of Norma Mccorvy‚Äôs statements after she changed her thoughts on abortion. She was basically duped by some lawyers to get the legal battle for abortion on track and later felt guilty for the death of MILLIONS of unborn.

Well‚Ä¶most of the time. The transactions I‚Äôve been involved with, for the most part, included a buyer and seller who welcomed the closing of escrow. Let‚Äôs just say some had a higher sense of relief than others.
Take Kent and John for example, we‚Äôve been walking through the sale of Kent‚Äôs office building to John in part 1 and part 2. This was mostly a straight-forward escrow with a timeline of 75 days. It would have been less, but John‚Äôs lender had a last minute report they needed which added two weeks.
There was also a credit John requested from Kent of $15,000 for an old boiler with asbestos insulation that needed to be removed after closing. This was not known until John performed his inspections. This did not add to the length of the escrow timeline, but was rather a slight detour.
Let‚Äôs use a train locomotive, railroad tracks and operating personnel as a metaphor to describe this entire process.
The purchase agreement is the railroad track that must be followed. The timeline, who is responsible for certain costs and is also responsible for certain tasks is included. It is all laid-out in front of us once the purchase agreement is ratified.
The escrow is the train locomotive. The escrow officer is the conductor‚Äìthe one who makes sure the train gets safely where it needs to go. The brokers act as the engineers orchestrating everything to reach the final destination while the buyer and seller are the trainmasters from whom we take direction.
The inspectors, contractors, lender, appraiser, title officer, etc. are all just along for the ride, but are essential in one way or another.
Oftentimes, we may need to hit the railroad switch and take a slight detour, but ultimately we must follow the path set by the purchase agreement.
Keeping with the railroad metaphor, trains have waybills while escrows have estimated closing statements and final closing statements.
There is a statement for the buyer and one for the seller. Each have a description, debit and credit column. The statement is an accounting, line-by-line, of the financial-side of a transaction.
Remember the $15,000 credit from seller to the buyer? This would show as a debit on the seller‚Äôs statement and a credit on the buyer‚Äôs.
You will find several debits and credits on each statement with the bottom line of each equaling the purchase price. This is basically double-entry accounting.
Other line items could be: loan amount, commission, inspection report cost, title insurance, prorated property taxes, loan fees, etc.
Escrows can be complicated that is why I treat my escrow officers kindly because they help make my job smoother and more efficient.

President Donald Trump pauses as he gives his first State of the Union address in the House chamber of the U.S. Capitol to a joint session of Congress Tuesday, in Washington, as Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan applaud.
Trump‚Äôs State of the Union address blended self-congratulation and calls for optimism amid a growing economy with dark warnings about deadly gangs, the scourge of drugs and violent immigrants living in the United States illegally. He cast the debate over immigration as a battle between heroes and villains, praising the work of an immigration agent who arrested more than 100 gang members and saluting the families of two alleged gang victims.
Country Characteristics and the Choice of the Exchange Rate Regime: Are Mini-skirts Followed by Maxis?
We use a sample of 140 countries to study empirically how a country's characteristics are associated with its choice of an exchange rate regime. When countries are classified according to their current exchange rate arrangements, we observe that small countries with low diversification of exports are the most likely candidates to peg their exchange rates. Other country characteristics, such as the level of development, openness of the real or financial sector, geographical diversification of exports, and fluctuations in the terms of trade, have hardly any power to explain the choice of an exchange rate system. Somewhat surprisingly, it is developing countries which have moved towards more flexible exchange rate practices during the last ten years, while countries with well diversified exports have adopted more rigid exchange rate arrangements. The regression results predict that Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom should have floating exchange rates, while Israel, New Zealand and Switzerland should adopt a more rigid exchange rate regime. Finland should adopt a regime of limited flexibility (such as the EMS) rather than peg to a basket or float.

NAACCR receives de-identified resident cancer case information from member registries across the US and Canada. With the permission of submitting registries, NAACCR combines the incidence data from registries that meet all NAACCR requirements for completeness and quality into a single comprehensive data file. This file, called the CiNA Deluxe Analytic File, is available to NAACCR members who are interested in using the data for cancer surveillance research and to NAACCR Committees/Subcommittees for approved analyses. Researchers may request access to the CiNA Deluxe Analytic File by submitting an application to NAACCR.
Applications are accepted any time and reviewed by the Research Application Review (RApR) Workgroup during its monthly conference call.
If, when proposing to analyze CiNA data, researchers select a single state or province as the research subject, the work group will request that the PI first contact the state or province central cancer registry for authorization to obtain their data for the proposed study. The work group will require direct authorization from the subject registry before the application will be considered.
Research proposals, all documents that accompany proposals, and communications about proposals are confidential. The volunteers who constitute the NAACCR Research Application and Review Workgroup (RApR) will maintain confidentiality of all documents related to CiNA requests.
The list below identifies the variables that are available in the file. Review the list to determine if the file contains the data necessary for your analysis.
Develop a working knowledge of cancer surveillance methods and an understanding of the data coding schemes used for your proposed study period.
Thoroughly review the Information for CiNA Deluxe Data Investigators.
Review and understand the CiNA Deluxe inclusion criteria, which central registries are included in the file, and the years for which data from each registry are included in the CiNA Deluxe data file.
If you are not a NAACCR member, contact a NAACCR member registry or other member organization and discuss your proposal idea to determine if it is feasible based on available CiNA Deluxe data. The principal investigator for any CiNA Deluxe application must be a NAACCR member. Researchers who are not NAACCR members may serve as co-investigators and/or apply for individual membership.
The links below provide the information on 1) the list of variables included in the CiNA Deluxe Analytic File data file and 2) registry data fitness-for-use (meeting high-quality incidence data standards).
If you have questions, suggestions, or comments regarding the CiNA Deluxe dataset, please email Dr. Recinda Sherman at rsherman@naaccr.org.

Cecily. This is no time for wearing the shallow mask of manners. When I see a spade I call it a spade. Gwendolen. [Satirically.] I am glad to say that I have never seen a spade. It is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different.
A man whose desire is to be something separate from himself, to be a member of Parliament, or a successful grocer, or a prominent solicitor, or a judge, or something equally tedious, invariably succeeds in being what he wants to be. That is his punishment. Those who want a mask have to wear it.

Violence in the name of religion can have no place in this country. India cannot and should not turn into a Nazi Germany, Pakistan or Arabistan.
Religious riots must be controlled with utmost severity. Reasons for the riots must be enquired into impartially. It is understood that the root cause was the demand of converted Christians to be declared as SCs/STs.
Demand for Relegation to backward castes has been the bane of our populist democracy. Politicians have been dividing the people into castes and more castes for votes. This must stop immediately.
I N ORISSA, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has ordered a judicial inquiry into the violence against Christian institutions. At the same time State Minister of Steel and Mines, Padmanabha Behera, has resigned owning ‚Äúmoral responsibility‚Äù for the Christmas carnage. These actions were taken after a curfew and after the presence of paramilitary forces proved to be no deterrents to the criminal elements who continued on their hate campaign. The minister‚Äôs resignation was one of the demands of the tribals in the district, who were opposing a proposal to grant Dalits the status of a Scheduled Caste. This hadn‚Äôt much to do with the attacks directly. So, the issuance of caveats by all parties to not ‚Äúmake this a political issue‚Äù rings hollow.
If this is not politics, nothing is. The state response leaves much to be desired.
ommunal vandalism and violence have been played out with almost meticulous precision. It is incomprehensible how 15 churches and in stitutes were targeted while there was no intelligence on the ground about any such activity Or did the state machinery . simply not bother?
Communal tension has festered in Orissa for years. One of its worst manifestations was the 1999 Graham Staines case, where the Australian missionary was burnt to death along with his two young sons.
While the murders shocked the nation, the case ended finally with a judgment that exposed the wide chasm between a deterring penalty and the ground realities. While the lower court sentenced the main perpetrator, Dara Singh, to death and 12 others to life imprisonment in September 2003, the Orissa High Court ended up commuting Singh‚Äôs death to life sentence and acquitted 11 of the others. The gap in the severity of the penalty , slashed to mere tokenism, cannot have sent the right signals to those inciting such hate crimes.
And clearly little has , been done to address the basic welfare issues involved in such communal divides. This is a politically-motivated crime and the upkeep of law and order is an issue that the state machinery alone can address.
Yet, the moves have been tactical and little is yet being done to grapple with the ground reality that Orissa may be becoming a cesspit of intolerance.
The rot must be stemmed now, Mr Patnaik‚Äôs reassurances notwithstanding.

No April‚Äôs Fool: Artlet Time!
Where did March go? Before I knew it the month was drawing to an end it was time to photograph the 31 Artlets, my way of journaling each morning. After challenging myself with words in January and the color Red in February I decided it was time to include some fabric into the Artlet journey.
While fondling the various stacks of hand-dyed and commercial fabrics I have accumulated over the past 12 years I settled on black and white. At first I didn‚Äôt expect to have enough prints to feature one for each day in March, however this was not the case‚Ä¶ I vaguely remember a time where I was mesmerized by the black and white section in quilt shops I visited. This was an advantage as I selected the stack of black, white and grey collection and affixed these securely to the card stock with PVA glue.
Soon I realized that I was bored with the high contrast. The solution was to add a splash of color whenever I felt like it or the morning was particularly grey. The results are visible in the slide show.
Initially I intended to add stitch and possibly even create mini-quilt blocks but soon I realized that activities like these would take up more than the 15 minutes designated to each Artlet. While stitches are a form of mark making I chose to add marks by moving felt tip markers and pencil crayons over the fabric instead of employing a needle and thread.
Enjoy the slide show and mark May 1st on your calendar if you are following the Artlet Journey! What will I explore next? I have an idea but you will have to wait till May to find out what I am exploring next.

Thought of you this past weekend and shared your Arlet idea with a lady who was doing a journal in stitches. She had the fabric rolled onto a piece of wood/dowling. Each day since January she has stitched something significant from that day. Her area per day is about two by six inches. Word spread quickly and she had to do show and tell numerous times. So creative.
Options to journal on a small scale are everywhere! I know knitters who knit one row a year with a color reflecting the mood of the day‚Ä¶ I wish there were more hours in a day to embrace all the wonderful ideas coming me way!
What a delightful collection. These March artlets have been particularly inspiring in their diversity,visual stimulation, and colour features you have added. I can really appreciate now, the value of making fabric artlets as a mini record of fabrics that have appealed to one at a given point in time and can enjoy again even many years later. Thank you Anna.
These were a lot of fun ‚Äì but as you notice‚Ä¶ I needed to add color to most of these! The grey weather in March and B/W fabrics was not well matched. As always ‚Äì a little color adds life!
You had me fooled but only for a minute, I thought that you had sketched all those pictures and you were becoming more unreachable. What a relief to see that they were fabrics. So beautiful. I will keep pressing on in my creations.
Unreachable??? Never ‚Äì for me it‚Äôs all about sharing not trying to outdo someone!
Remember ‚Äì the personal challenge I have set for myself is not to spend more than 15 minutes on each Artlet! Stay creative, Shirley!
Thanks for your feedback, Anara!
Amazing work! What fun with black and white a few pens and pencils. I can see where adding quilting would add so much more time. Love them just the way there are.
Thanks, Linda‚Ä¶. I put my creative cap on and am working on something totally different‚Ä¶ watch for May 1st!
I love the Artlets challenge! I had 4 of the same fabrics in my stash waiting for some artful project to come out of my mind!!!!
Really enjoyed your fabric slide show. That one that looks like a stack of lumber is so architecturally interesting!
Renewable Japan Co Ltd and Tokyu Land Corp will build a 62.7MW solar power plant in Kesennuma City, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan.
The company had a ground-breaking ceremony March 16, 2018. The plant is scheduled to be completed in March 2020.
About 196,000 solar panels will be installed on land owned by the city. The plant is expected to generate about 58,400,000kWh of electricity, which is equivalent to the amount consumed by 12,500 households, per year.
I read this great article and found it very interesting, thought it might be something for you. The article is called Renewable Japan Begins Construction of 62MW Solar Plant in Miyagi and is located at https://grendz.com/pin/6567/.

Jordanian protesters chant slogans against corruption during a March 15 anti-government demonstration in Amman. Jordanians have held Arab Spring-inspired protests since 2011, demanding political reforms and anti-corruption measures. The protests have been peaceful.
Across the turbulent Middle East, Arab revolts have toppled dictators and strongmen. Jordan remains stable for now but the pressure is mounting.
The Syrian war rages right next door, sending a flood of refugees across the border that has strained every resource in the kingdom.
Jordan shares the region's troubles: a faltering economy; rampant unemployment, especially among the young; and a popular demand for a say in how the country is governed.
"Jordan is stable, but you feel what is so unstable," says Labib Kamhawi, describing the contradictions. He is the head of the National Front for Reform, a coalition of political groups and civil society organizations. "The decision-making process is without any input from the people."
Jordan didn't escape Arab Spring protests. When it started in January 2011, demonstrators had some of the same demands as Syria's protest movement next door. But Jordan was different. Protesters stopped short of calling for the downfall of King Abdullah, the boyish-looking monarch educated in the U.S. and Britain.
Syrian refugees at Zaatari refugee camp in the Jordanian city of Mafraq, near the border with Syria, on April 25. The massive influx of refugees fleeing fighting in neighboring Syria is straining the Jordanian system.
And Jordan's security service was relatively restrained, handing out cold water and juice to protesters in a region where riot police regularly use clubs and guns to crush dissent.
"Violence and blood spilling in the region led to catastrophes," observes Ali Shukri, a retired general and former adviser at the royal palace.
The protest movement is smaller now, but the grievances have not gone away.
High-level corruption is the biggest complaint, says Kamhawi. In the latest scandal, a relative of the king fled to London after a parliamentary investigation into corruption charges. He is just one more official skimming millions, complains Kamhawi, as Jordan survives on foreign aid.
"People feel that this country is taken for a ride by a small group of people," Kamhawi says, and the economic ride for Jordanians is increasingly bumpy.
Jordanians want a bigger say in how the country is run, says Kamhawi. There are elections, but the king can dissolve Parliament and can hire and fire the prime minister.
The king has fired five prime ministers in the past three years. The government recently announced a dramatic rise in electricity prices, which could spark large protests again. But Jordan's political opposition remains fragmented, says Kamhawi.
"There is no alternative to the king and the monarchy," he says.
Jordan's King Abdullah, in the poster on the right, is shown next to his late father, King Hussein. Posters such as these reinforce the idea of continuity in a time of change.
Stability trumps concerns over the economy these days. The tensions are clear in Mafraq, a dusty town 40 miles from the Syrian border.
"We can hear daily, from midnight to 3 a.m., the constant barrage of bombings," says Amer al-Dughmi, who heads the tax office in Mafraq. "We even see the lights and the flashes from those explosions."
Mafraq lives with Syria's war every day, swamped by rebels and refugees.
The population there has more than doubled. As the town filled with Syrians, some Jordanians rented out their chicken coops and rooftops to refugees. International aid agencies picked up the inflated tab, complains the tax collector, driving prices out of reach for the locals.
"You basically now have a total breakdown of the economic model that we had before," he says.
Local marriages have been delayed because newlyweds can't find affordable housing. Refugees work longer hours for lower wages than the local residents.
Merchants complain that refugees hurt local business by selling food and tents they get for free from international aid workers. Jordanians are convinced Syrians have crowded them out of the local hospital as the caseload has more than tripled in two years.
At the local hospital, the administrator, Dr. Samir al-Mashakbey, points out that Jordan is one of the most "water poor" countries in the world. Jordanians are now complaining loudly, he says, because of the pressure on the system.
Still, Jordanians are grateful that they have not suffered from the violence they see in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere in the region.
Many Jordanians are now more hesitant to knock the Jordanian monarchy, says Ramzy Mardini, an analyst with the Jamestown Foundation.
"I think Syria has been a gift in disguise for King Abdullah," he says.
Mardini, based in Jordan, says regional violence and chaos have taken the steam out of Jordan's protest movement.
"Do they want stability or democracy? It's made that choice very clear," he says. "I think it's actually made Abdullah more secure in his position rather than less secure."
On billboards across Jordan, Abdullah's face beams down on his subjects. He is often pictured with his father, King Hussein, and his teenage son, a message of continuity in a chaotic time.
At a dinner party in an upscale neighborhood in the hills outside Amman, the guests say that at least Jordan is safe.
Naser Tahboub is the host for the meal. A professor, he is a member of the faculty at Jordan University's School of International Studies. The guests include some of his students, and his niece, May Tahboub, an architectural engineer.
The discussion is all politics: Should Jordan intervene in Syria? The overwhelming consensus is to stay out. Then the discussion turns to Jordan's protest movement and demands for wider democracy.
"It is definitely the case that the mood in Jordan has changed," declares Tahboub, the political science professor. His voice rises as he argues that Jordanians have lost confidence in a movement, he believes, that wants too much too soon.
"Are those who are on the extreme, demonstrating, some of them at least, can they deliver, can they do a better job?" he asks his students. "There is a great deal of skepticism."
Niece May speaks for a younger generation. She asks if Jordan can be stable, really safe, as long as Jordanians have no say in how the country is governed. But the threat from Syria and across other borders has changed even her calculations.
"We backed up, not because we are against striking or talking out loud," she says. "We don't know what to do."

Kennesaw State University President Dan Papp will retire from his position leading the school on June 30.
Papp announced his retirement in a letter to the Kennesaw State community Tuesday night.
‚ÄúIt has been a pleasure to serve as president of this great University for the past 10 years, and to enjoy a 43-year career with the University System of Georgia,‚Äù Papp said in the letter.
Papp says he informed system Chancellor Hank Huckaby of his retirement on Tuesday. The announcement comes as Kennesaw State is celebrating two days of commencement ceremonies for spring graduates.
During his tenure at Kennesaw State, Papp oversaw the consolidation of the university with the former Southern Polytechnic State University in Marietta. That consolidation has increased Kennesaw State‚Äôs enrollment to more than 33,000 students, making it one of the largest institutions in the state.
More information regarding an interim president will be announced in the coming weeks, Papp said.

On Tuesday night I went to dinner with the bf as he is heading off to America for a few weeks. We decided on Din Tai Fung for a few reasons 1. we have been saying to come for a long time and I had talked it up considerably after going a few years ago 2. the smaller version of the restaurant has opened in the new Westfield Sydney which has been great but we needed the full menu experience 3. I am completely obsessed with dumplings atm 4. I am even more obsessed with noodle soups that have dumplings in them.
For a Tuesday night the place was extremely busy and there was a fair few people outside waiting for a table. We put our name on the list and got given a copy of them menu to fill out and a buzzer to notify us when our table was ready. While we wait we grab a seat at the window outside and watch the chefs making the dumpling wrappers and filling them. The process seems extremely fiddly but the dumplings look oh so pretty, like little flowers. We waited for about 20mins for our table, by then we had chosen what we wanted and were seated at one of the large banquette like tables with the spinning lazy susan in the middle. It was a bit awkward sitting at a table with four other groups of people, especially when I kept pulling my camera out to get a shot. I had an urge to stand up and get better angled shots but I think I might have distracted all of the others a little too much.
Really love how pretty and perfect each of the dumplings are, and from making my own dumplings before I know how fiddly it is to get that shape.
We also ordered 6 pieces of the vegetable & pork jiao zi. Having the vegetables in the mixture makes the overall dumpling a bit drier in taste with a bit more crunch to each bite. I guess this type don‚Äôt have a broth in them either.
We had to order a dish with noodles as I remember them being really good and I have a feeling they also hand make them there, but I could be wrong. We went for a shrimp and pork wonton noodle soup. I added a few spoons of the chilli oil and bam..I was in heaven. On a cold day you cant go past one of these soups to warm you up. The wontons inside are also folded into a perfect round shape with the shrimp and pork flavour going well with each other, and providing a meatier taste.
Being all dumplinged out we started on the Taiwanese style black pepper steak which instantly became a favourite in my books. They surely were not shy with the pepper and it really did burn your whole mouth after a few bites. The steak was extremely tender and infused with the pepper flavour. The dish also came with an assortment of vegetables that had also been stir fried in the pepper marinade.
Lastly from the savoury menu we ordered the vegetarian rice fried with egg. The rice was light and not drowned in oil. You could choose other rice options with shrimps or meat but we decided to go with the plain choice so that it wouldn‚Äôt overtake the flavour of the steak and make the dish too heavy.
Nothing beats the end of a meal with some black sesame ice cream. I originally thought this was a mainly Japanese style dessert but I believe I could be wrong. The colour of the ice cream is not the most appealing, but what it lacks in looks it surely makes up in its sweet and nutty flavour. The ice cream was served with crushed black sesame; this gave it a crunchier texture which I prefer.
The ball is filled with black sesame paste with the outside being like a doughy bread mixture, very similar to the outside of a steamed pork bun (I‚Äôm guessing they are the same).
The service is very attentive; with staff covering your jacket on the back of your seat to make sure nothing is spilled onto it. The food came out pretty fast but in no set order so we received the rice and meat dish before the dumplings. It was a bit weird sharing a table with all these other people, but we got over that factor pretty quickly, and since it was just the two of us it was still easy to have a conversation. All up we paid just under $80 for the meal and were extremely full afterwards and happy that we got to try a variety of items from the menu. I will definitely be back again, and just from seeing how packed the place was on a Tuesday night you can tell that it is definitely one of the better Asian style restaurants in the city.

mmm i love dtf and the soup dumplings are just awesome!

PS ‚Äì Because this system will be even easier if you do it with a buddy, I urge you to forward this to friends and family members so you can team up with them.
In 2008 a study conducted at the University of Illinois studied the interaction of 2 diets (high protein, reduced carbohydrates vs low protein, high carbohydrates) with exercise on body composition and blood lipids in women during weight loss.
A cold-processed protein powder that also contains plenty of Branched Chain Amino Acids particularly Leucine is what you want to look for so that you can benefit from the lean muscle growth, increased metabolism, and accelerated fat loss. Make sure it is cold-processed protein because many cheaperprotein powdersuse heat in their processing methods. What this does is damage the fragile protein molecule and make the protein molecule less active and functional. Essentially you get protein that is not as effective as it could be.
It‚Äôs recommended that we eat 6-10 fruits and vegetables a day. Here in the States it is reported the actual average of fruits and veggies eaten each day is just 2.
Be sure to use these tips and comment below with some of your own tips.
One of the best ways to improve your body composition is by increasing lean muscle tone. When it comes to increasing muscle tone resistance exercise is the undisputed king.
It‚Äôs well-known that people who challenge their bodies with resistance exercises have more muscle than those who only use light weights and easy exercises. And, depending on the diet and other daily activities, these people often have less body fat.Challenging resistance exercises improves your body composition by stimulating muscle protein synthesis pathways and enhancing fat oxidation (burning) for several hours after your exercise session has completed.
Scientific studies have shown us that certain foods can enhance the amount of fat burned for energy several hours after the weight lifting session is over, and increase the amount of muscle synthesized.
Specifically, whey protein has been shown in many different scientific studies to increase muscle protein synthesis when take both before and after heavy resistance exercise. The best time to take whey protein for this effect is within 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after.
Recently, researchers from Michigan State University showed that when a whey protein supplement was taken before a heavy weight lifting session, resting energy expenditure (REE) was significantly elevated for 24 hours compared to a carbohydrate-only supplement.
REE is an important measure of the amount of calories you burn in one day and accounts for about 60-75% of your total daily energy expenditure. Thus, if you have a higher REE, you will burn more calories in the day and store less of them as body fat.
The whey protein supplement delivered important amino acids to muscle tissue during the exercise session which were used to enhance muscle protein synthesis for several hours after the exercises were over. These amino acids help speed muscle recovery and prevent excessive muscle soreness so you can lift heavy and hard again the next day.
Overall, if you‚Äôre looking to increase the amount of calories you burn after resistance exercise, which helps you build more muscle and lose more body fat, whey protein is the right way to fuel your body post-workout. Take whey protein within 30 minutes before and after exercise for the best effect and watch those fat cells run away in fear.

At the outset of WWII, Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued a statement that ‚ÄúAll combatants, under no circumstances undertake bombardment from the air of civilian populations.‚Äù US commanders, particularly General Frank Akers, believed that the best use of US air assets was precision bombing (as close as it got during the day) of specific military industrial targets. The British, however, felt differently about crossing the moral threshold of attacking noncombatants. British Air commander Arthur Harris said, ‚ÄúThe Nazis began this war under the rather silly notion that they were going to bomb everyone else and nobody was going to bomb them. At Rotterdam, Warsaw, London and a hundred other places, they put that rather na√Øve notion into use. They sewed the wind, and now they shall reap the whirlwind.‚Äù Churchill proclaimed that the side that bombed only military targets would certainly prevail. Often people with a conscience are compelled by the certitude of their own compassion and civility. The bombing o civilian infrastructure happened quite by accident.
In 1940, German bombers got lost over the English Channel and bombed a port city. Churchill was enraged and bombed Berlin. Hitler began a sustained bombing campaign against London and thus it began that non-combatants were free game in WWII.
On July 24th, 1942, British forces lined up 780 Lancaster bombers and launched a night raid against the northern factory town of Hamburg with a population of 1.5 million people under the name Operation Gomorrah. Hamburg was the second largest city in Germany behind Berlin and the chief manufacturing facilities for U-boats and ships of war were located there on the Elbe River. Hamburg itself was well defended with bunkers that could hold a quarter of a million people. Each bunker was able to withstand general bombing and each bunker held flak guns. Fifteen hundred ME-109s in airfields across the region protected Hamburg as well, all warned by Germany‚Äôs perfunctory radar warning system.
The British also had foil strips; today we call this chaff, and shoveled it out of their bombers to jam radars. The ten-hour raid was a masterpiece of air traffic control as it was conducted at night and involved almost 800 bombers. They hit the Blohm and Voss factory yards and all in all, the raid was a tremendous success militarily. Two days later the US sent 123 B-17s into Hamburg for a daylight raid. 20% of the B-17s were shot down, and the ME-109s were so well equipped and so determined that many went up, hit bombers and had the time to land and re arm and go up for a second run.
Sixty percent of Hamburg was destroyed and 45,000 people were killed. Over a million people fled the area and became instant refugees. The black eye delivered to the Germans was so embarrassing that Hitler refused to visit Hamburg and instead sent Goehring, head of the Luftwaffe.
A massive raid was planned for Berlin early the next year. The US 8th Air Force and British air assets launched 11,000 sorties against Berlin in ten days. The destruction was massive. 11,000 people were killed and 250,000 were made homeless. The British were convinced that if this pressure were maintained, the German would capitulate. Nothing further could be from the truth. The Germans showed no discernable loss of productivity or determination.
The internal fight between US air planner and British planners continued. The US felt that precision bombing of industrialize targets would be the best way to end the war, and the British felt a terror campaign would turn the tide. Neither side was completely correct.
On August 18th, 1943 General Akers ordered a daylight raid, unescorted against the ball bearing plants at Schweinfort. Again, it was a massacre of US aircrews with 20% casualties. US aircrews knew they had a 77% chance of dying before their 24 missions were over. The Brits also suffered high casualties; the RAF had lost 600 planes and 2700 flyers by the war‚Äôs end. The Schweinfort raid succeeded in hampering ball bearing manufacturing, and it also succeeded in ending Akers command. He was relieved of his duties and Jimmy Doolittle; the hero of the famous Doolittle Raid took over.
This time however, the Americans had a new long-range fighter, the P-51 Mustang. During bombing raids throughout the rest of 1943, Mustangs destroyed hundreds of ME-109s and Junker dive-bombers. Not only did they have the range, they had the speed as well. After escorting bombers in and out of Germany, the P-51s had enough fuel to drop down and strafe airfields over the French northwestern frontier and destroyed many German aircraft on the ground.
It‚Äôs interesting to note that during this intense battle, James Doolittle opposed bombing civilians. At the end of the day, even Eisenhower approved of Operation Thunderclap, a massive bombing campaign to flatten German cities both industrial and civilian. Experts believe that a half million Germans died as a direct result of the bombing campaign. Many Germans died of starvation in the streets or crowded into their bunkers during bombing raids. It‚Äôs also interesting to note that attacks on Leipsig and Berlin actually helped the Red Army overtake the still spirited and dangerous Wehrmacht.
Most Politicians Would Have Been Destroyed By A Fiasco Like Gallipoli. Not Winston Churchill.
Note that Operation Thunderclap never occurred. It was proposed, but ultimately decided against.
Well, if the first picture is of Hamburg in 1946 (one year after the war), and the third is of Hamburg after the war (presumably 1945 then?), then they did a marvelous job of rebuilding within a year‚Ä¶ You might want to look at the dates there.
Also apparantly the british did not ascribe the same toughness to the germans that they did to themselves, as ‚ÄúThe Blitz‚Äù only made the british more determined to end the war victorious‚Ä¶.
The first picture is NOT of Hamburg in 1946, it shows the old town of Frankfurt am Main in the area beetween the Dom and the town hall R√∂mer before it was completely destroyed at March 22 in 1944 by british forces.

The rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria has led to research on other therapeutic options in treatment of wounds. Honey has long been used in wounds to promote healing.
The process of wound healing involves a cascade of events described below (1).
This involves formation of a blood clot on the wound to impede bleeding. Blood vessels constrict restricting blood supply to the area. This is followed by adhesion of blood cells called platelets on the severed blood vessels forming a clot. Coagulation sets in by the interlocking of threadlike structures called fibrin into the clot converting into a gel like mass.
This stage involves growth of blood vessels which supply oxygen and nutrients on the wound bed. This promotes growth of granulation tissue which fills up the wound. Collagen produced by cells called fibroblasts aid in wound contraction while epithelial cells cover up the wound through a process called epithelialization. A moist and hydrated environment is required for optimal tissue growth.
In this stage the laid out connective tissue in the proliferative stage is reorganized leading to an increase in strength and flexibility.
Below we outline the properties of honey that make it a suitable treatment option in promoting wound healing (2,3).
Honey has dehydrating effects (hygroscopic) due to its high sugar content therefore inhibiting bacterial proliferation and growth in the wound even in the presence of exudates. Bacterial infection slows down wound healing.
Honey is activated when dilute (4) releases hydrogen peroxide slowly over a period of 24 hours. This prevents it from causing tissue damage as compared to commercially produced hydrogen over the same period of time. Hydrogen peroxide acts as an antiseptic and promotes growth of granulation tissue which helps foster wound contraction and consequently wound healing. Honey also contains antioxidants which prevent tissue damage from oxygen radicals produced by H2O2. Hydrogen peroxide activates tissue enzymes called proteases which help in debridement.
Honey has the ability neutralize malodors emanating from wounds due to infection. Bacteria breakdown amino acids present in necrotic tissue and exudates to produce ammonia, amines and sulphur compounds giving off a bad odor. Honey is rich in sugar (glucose) which when applied on wounds is metabolized by bacteria to lactic acid instead which has no off smell.
Honey is viscous in nature. This provides a protective barrier preventing invasion of infectious agents which cause cross infection. It also provides a moist environment which promotes growth of granulation tissue which is essential in wound healing.
It contains anti inflammatory properties. It prevents infiltration of inflammatory cells into the wound causing a reduction in edema, pain and inflammation while leaving a soothing effect.
Honey promotes tissue regeneration. Hydrogen peroxide stimulates growth of blood vessels which supply oxygen and nutrients and, fibroblasts (connective tissue cells which produce collagen) which are important in tissue growth. It‚Äôs high acidity and osmotic pressure promotes blood circulation and oxygenation which is essential for the tissue growth. Honey also contains vitamins, amino acids and other nutrients which are essential in the proliferative stage of wound healing.
Honey can also be used in wound dressings. It‚Äôs popularly used in burn wounds since its non adherent therefore minimizing trauma to the tissues and pain.
Honey inhibits production of prostaglandins which mediate the process inflammation, pain and cause immunosupression by inhibiting production of antibodies. A decrease prostaglandin levels consequently stimulates production of antibodies which are important for debridement in the inflammatory stage.
Honey is also more affordable compared to other conventional wound treatment methods.

1. Dreadful Property - Even Worse Agents!
Be warned, Amber and Co are the worst agents I have ever had to deal with. The property was in awful condition when we moved in and we had to put up with an almost daily leak coming from the flat upstairs, flooding into our bathroom. It took them almost a year to sort it out! Many other things broke such as the gas hob, the boiler, another leak in the living room. It took so long for them to respond to emails and telephone messages that by the time one thing was sorted out, another issue had developed. Moving out was the best thing we ever did. The neighbours either side are very strange who put their rubbish out in Tesco bags every day so that foxes rip them open at night and spread the mess into OUR garden - tried to talk to them about this and was met with a very aggressive response.

Africa‚Äô bloodiest civil war pillaged the Lion Mountain of this continent, a decade of senseless war raged in Sierra Leone, fuelled by Blood Diamonds. Men, women and children‚Äôs hands, arms, limbs and feet were hacked off by the swing of a machete. The perpetrators were disillusioned rebels under the command of Liberian War lord; Charles Taylor .The war inflicted a heavy toll on human capital. With approximately 20,000 deaths, 20 million displaced some 27,000 registered amputees according to UN analysis.
&apos;The Devil in Freetown (January 6)&apos; is Collins Archie-Pearce&apos;s latest venture. It depicts a true recounting of Sierra Leone‚Äôs ten year civil war. The ethos of this movie is to showcase the resilience of Sierra Leone and her people in rising up from the ashes of the war despite the human, structural and societal destruction it experience. This beautiful story line brought to life by the first-hand information volunteered by those who were affected by the war demonstrating the trauma that they went through. The date January 6th 1999, will be forever etched in the minds of Sierra Leoneans as the bloodiest day of the war. The movie reveals tha inhumane activities which took place in what had once been one of Africa‚Äôs most peaceful country.
War brings pain, despair, insurmountable loss and desolation. The message to everyone especially Sierra Leoneans is clear - the peace of one‚Äôs country/native land must be maintained and preserved at all cost. Hence the effects of this &apos;Blood Diamonds&apos; fuelled war are still prevalent in the lives of many today ‚Äì the war afflicted amputees.
70% of the population are living below poverty line, 26% are classified as extremely poor with the majority categorised as physically challenged. Life expectancy is 39 years whilst health and education indicators are among the lowest in the world. Many amputees in the provinces are not registered due to lack of access to auditing.
The producers of Devil in Freetown have pledged to render a percentage of the movie premiere‚Äôs proceeds to Melqosh Mission International, a UK based Charity, birthed to equip, educate and empower war afflicted amputees and their dependents. For more information about this humanitarian organisation, please visit their website.
Born: July 25, 1817, near Lexington, Kentucky.
Died: August 11, 1862, during the Battle of Independence, Missouri.
Buried: Woodlawn Cemetery in Independence, Missouri.
Colonel John T. Hughes was considered near kin to General Sterling Price, and enjoyed the trust and confidence of that great man. John Hughes had been with Sterling Price through the Mexican War, and the two men understood and loved each other as brothers. At the battle of Pea Ridge, when Slack fell mortally wounded, Price, who seldom made mistakes in choosing men for arduous duties, assigned Hughes to replace the fallen general. Price saw in Hughes the coming man and in this Price and Doniphan saw alike. After the battle of Pea Ridge, Hughes followed his kinsman to assist in the operations against Grant and Halleck, at Corinth.	In one month he was directed by the Confederate Government, at Richmond, to return to Missouri, and raise a brigade; which meant a	generalship for him. He was on this mission, making his way to northwestern Missouri, when he brought together, near Lee's Summit, the forces of Thompson, Hays, and Quantrill, and planned so skillfully the battle of Independence. It was during this engagement that John T. Hughes lost his life.
John T. Hughes was more than a rising general. He was a graceful writer	as well, and had he lived, would have done for Price, what Edwards did for Shelby-chronicled in classic English his achievements.	Prior to the War Between the States, John Hughes was one of the leaders of political sentiment in Northwestern Missouri. He had been a Whig all his life, until the Whig party became dominated by Knownothingism, when he acted with the Democrats. This was due to what he felt was the violent and radical assaults of the leaders of the then forming Republican Party on the Constitution. This made it impossible for him to act with them. He was a member of the State Convention that sent delegates to the National Democratic Convention of 1860, the most stormy political assemblage, perhaps, that ever met in Missouri-one of which none but the master hand of Price could control.
He held a commission as Colonel in the Missouri State Guard, which was the state militia at that time. When the Federal government usurped the will of the people, and ousted not only the duly elected Governor of Missouri, but the members of the State House of Representatives, the State Senate, the State Supreme Court, State of Missouri District Judges and all other state officers.	He moved the troops under his command and took his place alongside that brave and noble band of patriots who fought and were willing to die for their beliefs.
On August 11, 1862, Colonel John T. Hughes, commander of the Confederate troops, was killed by a shot to the head while leading a surprise attack against Federal forces. The volley came from troops under the leadership of Captains Breckinridge and Axline. Colonel Hughes fell motionless to the ground while leading a charge against the right flank of Captain Axline's position.
The surprise attack came from the Confederate Troops and Quantrill's Partisan Rangers. Captain Breckinridge was taken by such surprise that he immediately shouted: "Boys, we are completely surrounded, and we had better surrender." This was the first command heard by the troops, but it was not long before Captain Axline was able to successfully counter that order and get their men to rally a few yards from here behind a stone fence.
Captain Axline was able to repel several charges from the Confederates on this location before he received a message from over-all commander Lieutenant-Colonel James Buel ordering him to surrender to Colonel Thompson. Colonel Thompson succeeded command of the Confederates after the death of Colonel Hughes. Captain Axline reluctantly surrendered.
Promoted posthumously to Brigadier General, John T. Hughes.	The ideas and opinions are representative of B/G John T. Hughes SCV Camp #614, and L. Col. John	R. Boyd MOSB Chapter #236.

During History lessons, Class 4 are finding out about the Vikings.
We used lego to find equivalent fractions. Once we had mastered this, we tested our knowledge using cake. What a fun morning!
In English, we composed animal poems using alliteration. We used our dictionary skills to improve our vocabulary.
During their History lesson, Class 4 investigated how Neolithic people managed to build Stonehenge (October 2018).
In maths, we have been looking at more exciting ways to learn our times tables. We evented a game called ‚ÄòBunny Maths‚Äô and had great fun hopping around the classroom, collecting bundles of carrots. We challenged ourselves to see how many questions we could answer in 1 minute.
We have also been looking at more complicated multiplication. In Year 4, we think it is very important to be able to explain our thinking, so Mrs Hughes decided to it was time to take a back seat and let the class do the teaching! Everyone stepped up to the challenge and did an amazing job! Well done, Year 4!
During our first week, we talked about the characteristics that make a good friend. We used our ideas to create a friendship advertisement. Can you work out which friend is which?
In Maths, we have been looking at place value of 4 digits numbers. We also used our class novel, The Iron Man, to fit in some extra measuring skills. We estimated that we could fit approximately 300 of us in the same space as the Iron Man's head, now, that's impressive!
Viking longboats made during History lessons set sail (June 2018).
Excitement continued today when we received a letter from the Museum of Strange Objects, asking us to keep a look out for dragon eggs. On our patrols around the school, to our amazement, we found not just one, not two, not three, but FOUR giant ones scattered around the playground. We used our senses to examine these closely and will be reporting back to the Museum of Strange Objects when we have completed our investigations. What an egg-citing day!
Class 5 and Class 4 went to Upper Sitch Private Wood in Staffordshire to find out more about the Stone Age. Dan and Naomi told us all about their experiences living as Stone Age people in America. During the afternoon we made Stone Age tools and used natural materials to create our own cave art.
These brave men and women were not bashful about their devotion and service to God. They made sure that honor was given to God in their community. Parents taught their children the scriptures and made sure that they understood the importance of worshipping God in their lives and in their community.
Generations passed and parents stopped teaching their children the importance of faith in God and his place in society and instead shipped them off to government-run institutions where our children learned secular humanism and that God did not belong in the public square.
In the churches throughout the land, a place that once held significance in the local community, and was instrumental in public discourse on all things of societal life, pulpits were being filled with teachers who taught that a Christian‚Äôs citizenship was not of this world so they were not to bother themselves with the dirt and grime of politics and civics in general. Evangelicals were told to stay out of politics since it was worldly and corrupt. This left a void which was gladly filled by those who did not hold to Christian values and as such led our government down into the depths of humanism and away from God. The church said and did nothing for decades.
Now we find ourselves where we are today, adrift on the sea of worldliness driven by the winds of tyranny and debauchery. What do we find church leaders and evangelicals doing while the ship of state flounders in turbulent waters? They are supporting a secularist for the highest office in the land.
America needs a revival of spiritual fervor, a new Pentecost which will cause the body of Christ to burn with the spiritual passion once held by the pilgrims. A righteous indignation that will cause the people of God to fall on their faces and cry out to a merciful God to forgive them for their indifference and failures to pray for their leaders. America you have sinned, we have sinned against God and brought this hell down upon ourselves, we have no one to blame but ourselves.
Do we really want America back? Back to the foundations laid by the Pilgrims? Do we really wish to see one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all? Then we MUST put God back where he belongs front and center in our lives and in our communities, and yes in our government. We as a nation need to vote for God in this election and those that are to follow.
And that is the way I see it. What say you?
‚Üê Are Conservatives Really Conservative?

ELGIN, Ill. -- The Siena Heights men's volleyball team split on day two of the Judson Tournament for an overall record of 3-1 for the two-day tournament. The Saints began the day with a four-set win over Lincoln (Ill.) before a four-set loss to Mount Mercy finished the tournament. Keegan Crawford paced the SHU attack with 76 assists for the day.
Lincoln (Ill.) bested the Saints in the opening set of the first match when the team won in extras 26-24. Siena bounced back with a 14-kill (.393) performance in the second game to tie the set score at one apiece. Set three was the Saints best as they tallied 15 kills and had a hitting percentage of .448, the highest of the match, on the way to a 25-17 decision and a 2-1 advantage in sets. SHU held the Lynx to just .062 hitting in the fourth set to close out the match.
Mount Mercy jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the Saints final match of the tournament. Siena rallied back in the third set with a 26-24 win to cut the deficit to 2-1 in the set score. Mount Mercy would end the rally in the fourth set with a 25-19 win.
‚Ä¢ Emmanuel Chaidez led the Saints attack in the first match with 14 kills. He also contributed defensively with four blocks.
‚Ä¢ Evan Cashen and Alex Garavalia totaled 12 kills against Lincoln (Ill.). Cashen added 12 digs, a team-high, to his stat line in the first match.
‚Ä¢ Crawford finished with 44 of his total assists in the opener of day two.
‚Ä¢ Emilier De Jesus led in kills (11) and digs (19) against Mount Mercy.
‚Ä¢ Charles Carter led Lincoln in kills with 15. Nick Washington and Bryan Orellana split the setting duties with 19 assists each. Trenton Kielion and Jack Lindner each finished with 11 digs.

The Saints return to Illinois next Friday, February 15 to face Saint Xavier (Ill.) at 8:00 p.m.
The college admissions interview is a valuable component of college applications because it provides admissions officers with a holistic evaluation from a source that has no vested interest in your success. This contrasts with your teacher evaluations, which are holistic but (hopefully) written by people who want you to be admitted, and your standardized tests scores, which aren't biased towards your success the way that teacher evaluations are, but which aren't holistic at all.
There's no excuse for not knowing about one of the schools you're applying to attend. In the case of UChicago, read up on its core curriculum, housing system, culture, student groups, neighborhood, academic programs, and so on. Any school wants to admit students who know a lot about it and would be excited to attend, so study up beforehand and then reflect that in your interview. Don't ask your interviewer any questions you could have answered yourself by looking online beforehand; that's a poor use of your time with them. Definitely do ask questions, though--just ones whose answers you can't find through other resources.
A few minutes late is fine, but it's impolite to keep anyone waiting for much longer than that. Pad your arrival time by ten minutes or so to account for having difficulty parking or finding the interview location. I'm personally not that uptight about this, but other people potentially could be.
...not an interrogation. I'm hoping to keep the dynamic of the interview relatively symmetric. UChicago is looking for is students who will make good conversationalists, because much of the learning at UChicago happens outside of the classroom in conversations with your peers. I'm sure the same is true of most schools. So when there's a pause in the conversation, feel very free to fill it by changing the subject, asking a question, or telling a story. Feel free to direct the conversation to the topics that most interest you, just as you would when talking to your friends.
A corollary of this attempt to foster an equal footing is that there is no need to dress up for your interview if you don't want to. Personally, I'll probably be wearing tennis shoes, jeans, and a t-shirt with some kind of math joke on it.
Don't be arrogant either, of course, but absolutely don't let modesty keep you from telling your interviewer about accomplishments you've had just because they didn't explicitly ask. Modesty is a virtue in many other contexts, but not in the college admissions process!
UChicago looks for people who are really excited about learning and their work. Convey that enthusiasm in the interview! That means talking excitedly about your favorite academic subjects, the work that you do, things you do outside of class, ideas you have, and so on.
I wouldn't have thought of this myself, but several of the students I interviewed gave me a resume or cheat sheet about themselves, or emailed me one at some point. I was frankly surprised at this, as I certainly didn't have a resume in my last year of high school. But when it came time to write up my interview reports, having a little reminder of the person I talked to was surprisingly helpful in reminding me of their accomplishments and of what we had talked about.
So I'd recommend giving your interviewer something like this at some point, or perhaps better yet, emailing it to them so they can't lose it. If you don't have a resume, (and again, not a big deal--I didn't either in high school!), you can achieve the same goal by sending your interviewer a short email that basically says, "Hey, it was great talking about X, Y, and Z with you!"
I got a strong education at UChicago and had a great time while I was there. (Indeed, my friends know all too well that at least half my stories begin, "When I was at UChicago...") So if you're applying to UChicago, then I'm delighted that you're interested in going there! If you're not, then I'd urge you to! In any case, I wish you the best of luck with your college admissions process, and particularly with any college interviews you may have.
Disclaimer: I'm just an alum, not a UChicago admissions officer. Thus, language like "UChicago looks for..." is a mixture of conjecture and prescriptive opinion about what I think UChicago Admissions ought to do. Some of this advice applies to college interviews in general, some only to interviews for UChicago, and some just for interviews with me.
mine's probably Take It From the Man!
and I don't remember what it's called. Tis ok-pretty good. I did see Anton throw a tantrum at the Troubadour just like he does in Dig! though. That was fun.
and just gets on with playing a good show. it pisses me off how people keep taunting him from the crowd.
but so many of the BJM albums are different from each other, you'd best get another!
god they're so bloody good.
i love the production on Take It From The Man! it sounds like it's some old sixties recording.
but based on quality of songs i'll have to go with Give It Back!
from that album. such a dirty spaced out riff at the start.
It's so sad the way our culture doesn't understand real rock'n'roll.
About three songs into Dig!, I knew I was in the presence of greatness and I just thought...how have these bastards kept this band from me for so long?
Was really into them in 1999-2000 ish, completely lost interest after that. Any of their later material worth while?
if you ducked out before Bravery Repetition And Noise...get the hell back in there!
These days they're not quite the band they were, but still far better than whatever's flavour of the month.
ended up seeing them live last year. quite boring and extremely long... I ended up leaving before the end. This is the only concert where I've ever done this!
for me, but they've got so many great standalone songs as well ('Crushed', 'Not If You Were The Last Dandy', 'That Girl Suicide', 'Hyperventilation' ) that it's hard to pick one out.
is the best album for me. I'm wearing my BJM t-shirt at work today and i've had to explain what it means/who they are to 4 separate people. Ahhh i love spreading the word to my un-educated work chums!

This is our second session of ‚ÄúIwata Asks‚Äù covering The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. I‚Äôve gathered you all here to talk about the theme ‚ÄúThe Dense Forest.‚Äù Please say what you worked on and introduce yourself. Fujibayashi-san was in the previous session, so let‚Äôs start with Asuke-san.
the area called the Sealed Grounds, the land that Link falls to at the beginning from the floating island named Skyloft . It‚Äôs an area that serves as a kind of connection point before you reach the game fields and dungeons. It‚Äôs an incredibly important place in the story.
Its name - the Sealed Grounds - suggests there‚Äôs something significant about it.
Yes. (laughs) A huge boss appears there. I was in charge of the area where you fight it.
I‚Äôm Hiramuki, also from EAD. The first game I worked on at Nintendo was Pikmin.1 After that, I worked on the fields of Pikmin for a long time, but then I became involved with The Legend of Zelda with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass2 for the Nintendo DS system. 1Pikmin: An AI action game for the Nintendo GameCube system in which the player searches for hidden treasure while accompanied by mysterious creatures known as Pikmin. The first game was released in October 2001 in Japan and the second game in April 2004 in Japan. Both titles were also released as part of the New Play Control! series of games for the Wii console in December 2008 and March 2009 in Japan. 2The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass: A stylus-controlled action-adventure game released in June 2007 in Japan as the first title in The Legend of Zelda series for the Nintendo DS system.
Then you started working together with Fujibayashi-san.
the dungeon called Skyview Temple .
I‚Äôm Ito from EAD. I was in charge of the overall special effects. Since joining the company, I have worked on The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker3, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess4 and The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks5, so this game was my fourth Legend of Zelda title. 3The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker: An action-adventure game released for the Nintendo GameCube system in December 2002 in Japan. 4The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess: An action-adventure game released for the Wii console and Nintendo GameCube system in November 2006. 5The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks: An action-adventure game released for the Nintendo DS system in December 2009.
We can always leave the special effects for The Legend of Zelda games to you.
To start off, this Legend of Zelda game is structured so as to provide the enjoyment of playing in familiar places. So rather than making a bunch of new game fields - as in past games - you wanted to create fields where the player can go through more than once to thoroughly enjoy the environment. First, I would like you to talk about why you decided to make it like that.
Miyamoto-san has always said that to Aonuma-san - and this time Aonuma-san said it to you! (laughs) If you make a bunch of new fields, and just stretch it out, it just gets big and can be a bit of a drag.
That‚Äôs right. I thought we could discover a new pleasure if, instead of just stretching it out, we made fields with height and depth, so that every time you went to one, you would experience a fresh surprise and discover new enjoyment.
In other words, compact doesn‚Äôt literally mean small and cramped game fields, but denser ones, while still compact.
So Hiramuki-san planned the first game field and dungeon, but you were the one who asked him to?
Yes. The forest that is the first game field is a really important place, so I asked Hiramuki-san as someone who would give it his full attention.
You worked together with Hiramuki-san on The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, so you‚Äôre old partners.
Hiramuki-san, what was on your mind as you made the forest?
Well, the forest is the first game field you visit, so I thought the most important thing was helping players get into the world of The Legend of Zelda naturally.
The first game field is incredibly important. If it makes a bad impression, players won‚Äôt go any further.
That‚Äôs right. So I decided to give the forest a bright and fun atmosphere.
Until now in the series, most of the forests have always been dim and creepy.
big mushrooms growing there and all kinds of animals and insects and little birds .
Yes. (laughs) The Bug Net is in the item selection circle along with the Bow and Bomb. It stands out - in a good way - and I think it‚Äôs very characteristic of the Legend of Zelda games.
When you actually try to catch bugs with that net, you get really tense.
That‚Äôs how realistic it is. You can experience a thrill like when you catch real cicadas or grasshoppers.
Oh, I see. The Wii MotionPlus accessory doesn‚Äôt just allow you to swing the sword however you want, but the Bug Net as well.
That‚Äôs right. The direction you swing the net is very important.
At first, you don‚Äôt have the knack for it, so you‚Äôre swinging it around all over, but it isn‚Äôt long before you get the hang of it. You say, ‚ÄúThis is the perfect angle,‚Äù and change your grip as you go around catching bugs.
And the way you do it has to change for each kind of bug. Sometimes you sweep down from above and sometimes you scoop them up from underneath.
Hmm, bug-catching itself is quite deep. The way the team puts such an astounding amount of effort on things like this really is a part of the essence of Zelda.
Yes. There are all kinds of bugs, like grasshoppers and cicadas, dragonflies and butterflies, unicorn beetles and stag beetles and mantises. There are different kinds of birds, too. It hardly ever shows up, but there‚Äôs a blue bird, too. When I see one, I shout, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the blue one!‚Äù (laughs) and get all excited and sneak up on it, and feel great when I catch it.
Do you get anything for catching insects and birds?
I think I‚Äôll talk about that some other time.

The departed men in her life still have plenty to say to Corey. Her father, a legendary rodeo cowboy who punctuated his lifelong pronouncements with a bullet to his head, may be the loudest. But in this story of Montana‚Äîa story in which the old West meets the new and tradition has its way with just about everyone‚Äîit is Corey‚Äôs voice we listen to. In this tour-de-force of voices big and small, sure and faltering, hers comes across resonant and clear, directing us to the heart of the matter.
Played out against the mythology of the Old West‚Äîa powerful amalgam of ranching history, Marlboro Men, and train robbery reenactments‚Äîthe story of the newly orphaned, spinsterish Corey is a sometimes comical, sometimes poignant tale of coming-of-age a little late. As she tries to recapture an old dream of becoming a painter‚Äîof preserving some modicum of true art amid the virtual reality of modern Montana‚ÄîCorey finds herself figuring in other dramas as well, other, younger lives already at least as lost as her own.
Mary Clearman Blew is the author of the acclaimed essay collection All But the Waltz; three books of short stories, including Sister Coyote; and is the editor of When Montana and I Were Young: A Memoir of a Frontier Childhood, available in a Bison Books edition.

Wear this lace long-sleeve short sheath party dress to your next semi-formal event.
Although we haven‚Äôt played any gigs since September, we‚Äôve been busy with other stuff. We have 5 new songs in the pipeline that will be recorded and released as an EP sometime in March if all goes well. 3 out of the 5 songs will satisfy your punk rock needs while with the remaining 2 we‚Äôll experiment more in guitar pop territory. All the songs are at least 2 and a half minutes long, and we‚Äôll record all of them in English and Hungarian as well, so this will be our longest release since Shorter Than Danny DeVito.
At the end of last year we also started looking for a second guitar player. This project is on hold now due to the recording preparations, but we‚Äôll get back to this once the EP is ready. We have a candidate who seems to fit right in, but he‚Äôd need to move to Budapest first, which may or may not happen in the near future. We hope it will.
We have also started booking gigs for the spring and summer, the first dates are already up ‚Äì only Hungary so far, but hopefully we‚Äôll get more invitations soon.
These double stacked 3D Mink lashes are cut and shaped in a way to create a stunning cat eye. Like our other three 3D styles, ‚ÄúStarlet‚Äù provides maximum thickness without the weight!
Please note: All lashes come in a standard size that may need trimming to fit your eye size and shape. We suggest to trim from the outer edge not the inner edge!
What if your father was one of the 20th century‚Äôs most celebrated painters? How would you define yourself against that kind of talent and machismo?
In The Italian Teacher, his third novel, Tom Rachman sets in play just that dynamic. Bear Bavinsky is a world-famous painter, a first-class narcissist and father of 17 children who he treats with careless, sometimes callous, warmth.
Bear‚Äôs shy son Pinch loves to paint, but his ambitions are snuffed by his father‚Äôs offhand critique: ‚ÄúI got to tell you, kiddo. You‚Äôre not an artist and you never will be.‚Äù After that, nothing in Pinch‚Äôs life seems to gel.
When Bear abandons his family, Pinch strives to make himself worthy of his father‚Äôs attention, first trying to be a painter himself; then resolving to write his father‚Äôs biography; eventually settling, disillusioned, into a job as an Italian teacher in London.
With Rachman‚Äôs signature humanity and humor, The Italian Teacher examines a life lived in the shadow of greatness. If you enjoyed William Boyd‚Äôs Any Human Heart, you‚Äôll love this portrait of Pinch, who has the good luck to both outlive and survive his famous father, and to find, in the end, a way to take ownership of his difficult legacy.

Another drawing from Hudson, Ohio. This is the town's bandstand where weekly concerts are held on Sunday nights in the summer.
This one has the names, "Tim", "Sandee", "Luke", and "Tyler" hidden in it. Maybe you can find them by clicking on this picture and looking around.
Heavy stock paper, rapidograph pen, the usual thing. Lots of pen strokes.
Discover God in the world around you.
"Our world is saturated with grace, and the lurking presence of God is revealed not only in spirit but in matter ‚Äì in a deer leaping across a meadow, in the flight of an eagle, in fire and water, in a rainbow after a summer storm, in a gentle doe streaking through a forest, in Beethoven‚Äôs Ninth Symphony, in a child licking a chocolate ice cream cone, in a woman with windblown hair. God intended for us to discover His loving presence in the world around us."
Do you know the name of the Artist who made this scene? I simply took a picture in HIS presence.
Look for this picture to be turned into a "Shuwork" in the near future.
I drew this picture a number of years ago. This town is just north of my hometown of Stow, Ohio.
I have always liked the views in this town. This clock tower is a well known landmark.
I enjoyed drawing this picture, however, that's a lot of leaves to draw, ain't it?
Pen: Rapidograph technical pen, 0.25 and 0.35, naturally.
Three best tools for pen and ink work - .35, .25 Rapidograph, .38 Uni-ball.
Close up of the .25 rapidograph. There is a lot of relaxation in the point of that pen. These pens can be expensive in the store, but you can find great deals of ebay. I did.
Here are the sermon notes from this morning at Black Forest Christian Fellowship. Mr. Jerry DeRenzo, a middle school teacher at BFA, spoke on God's love.
Jerry's messages are always full of great word pictures that are easy to draw into notes. Thanks Jerry for the encouragement today.
- Paper: Moleskine blank journal, 5.25x8.25, 13x21cm, what a great book! The paper is heavy and smooth, and takes gel ink perfectly.

SEATTLE - If you look up the term "sport utility vehicle" in your handy World Book Encyclopedia, don‚Äôt be surprised to find a picture of a Word War II Jeep prominently displayed at the top of the page.
Sure, the burbs are now crawling with sport-utes capable of satisfying the diverse needs of every sporting cult and off-road religion imaginable. We have everything from the mini-sport-utes such as the Chevy Tracker, Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V, to the big luxo-barges such as the Range Rover, Lincoln Navigator and GMC Denali.
Surprisingly, what started out as a simple, yet durable conveyance that could take you beyond the end of the trail - a Jeep - wound up trailblazing a market segment that has been dividing and multiplying like an amoeba run amok. The number of sport-utility nameplates totals at least three dozen, with perhaps a dozen more on the way - including new models from Ford, Mazda, BMW, Cadillac, Volkswagen, Porsche and Nissan.
While today‚Äôs teens probably think it was always like this, it wasn‚Äôt. In fact, in 1984, just a scant 15 model-years ago, Jeep (then part of American Motors) introduced the very first compact four-door Cherokee. The only other four-door sport-utes available at the time were big brutes, such as the Jeep Grand Wagoneer, Chevy/GMC Suburban, Toyota Land Cruiser and International Travel-all (remember that one?).
If you happened to come from a dyed-in-the-wool Jeep family, your dad may have driven a Grand Wagoneer or CJ5, while your granddad drove a Willys Jeep - in WWII.
Frankly, it wasn‚Äôt until the arrival of the first Jeep Grand Cherokee in 1992 (a Chrysler brand by this time), that the carlike sport-utility market really started growing in earnest.
So what‚Äôs a company such as Jeep going to do, with everybody and their brother-in-law trying to push you off the trail and take away your business?
After a daylong trek along winding Washington backroads and over rutted logging trails, the answer is quite evident: leave them in your dust. Without exaggeration, that seems to be precisely what Jeep has done with the introduction of its virtually all-new 1999 Grand Cherokee. While that may seem like a tall order, it‚Äôs something Chrysler has some experience doing. As most people will recall, Chrysler also invented the minivan market and has done a more than adequate job of protecting its "home turf" with each succeeding version of its popular minivan.
So given the monumental assault on the Jeep brand, it‚Äôs not the least bit surprising to find Chrysler doing the same thing all over again. What that means, down here where the rubber meets the road, is not being content to rest on your laurels. And for the Grand Cherokee, that would have been an easy thing to do. With over a dozen awards under its beltline, the Grand Cherokee has impressed every off-road magazine and organization on the planet. But Chrysler realized that standing pat would be sure suicide.
Just to prove that didn‚Äôt happen, communications guru Bud Liebler proudly displayed the little bag of 127 carry-over parts that are the only remnants of the previous Grand Cherokee still attached to the 1999 model. Other than the oil filter, key fob and rearview mirror, the remaining bits and pieces are mostly nuts, bolts and other fasteners.
"We are well aware that in this extremely competitive segment, the battle for the best sport-utility vehicle is being fought on-road as well as off-road," said Tom Gale, executive vice president - Product Strategy, Design and general manager Jeep Operations. "We are not about to yield to anyone when it comes to delivering the best combination of capability and comfort. We plan to keep aggressively building on Grand Cherokee's strong sales record and award-winning history."
As more and more automakers "top off" their product lines with sport-utility vehicles, the Jeep brand stands out as the only American brand dedicated solely to this market segment -- and one that has been continuously refined for more than five decades.
Major changes to the all-new 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee include all-new exterior and interior design, two all-new engines, a new five-speed automatic transmission, a much-refined new Quadra-Drive‚Ñ¢ 4WD system, new suspensions front and rear, new steering system, and an all-new braking system. It may seem like a lot of tinkering was done to an already outstanding product, but as a result of these changes, the 1999 Grand Cherokee now has new levels of luxury, refinement, performance, handling and innovation combined with robust, Rubicon-proven capability that put it in a class by itself.
First we‚Äôll start with the new design.
The look of this new Grand Cherokee retains the character of the previous model, but is more fluid, refined and dynamic. Flanked by jewellike round quad-headlamps, the signature Jeep grille sits at a more rakish tilt and is less angular. From the side, it‚Äôs characterized by a steeply raked windshield, arced roof and stretched trapezoidal wheel arches, which work together to give the vehicle a more athletic stance. In the rear, the bold tri-color taillamps are larger, and more distinctive.
The new Grand Cherokee rides on the same wheelbase but has an inch wider track, is 4.4 inches longer, 2.2 inches higher and 1.6 inches wider than the previous-generation vehicle. Step-in height is reduced by 1.1 inches, for easier entry. However, the seating position is actually an inch higher for better "command-of-the-road" vision.
If luxury is what you‚Äôre looking for, the Grand Cherokee certainly does not disappoint. The interior offers refined luxury, with excellent fit, finish and refinement throughout the cabin, as well as an ergonomic design. The driver now has all primary controls at fingertip distance, grouped on stalks around the steering wheel. Even most radio/cassette/compact disc controls are integrated on the back of the steering wheel. There‚Äôs also an excellent blend of materials and textures, plus an obvious attention to detail in the many soft-touch surfaces.

no diffence to the Owls & Kestrels who use our boxes, all designs create the perfect roost & nest sites.
Welcome to the Barn Owl Centre's Nest Box Page to support nesting Barn Owls.
Buy with confidence & be assured that you are being supplied a nest box that is made by a dedicated Owl Conservation charity. The safety of nest boxes are very important to us & the birds we build them for.
With 14 years of experience working closely with Owls & Kestrels in the wild we are pleased that the nest boxes we make are spread over all areas of the UK countryside, we feel very proud that we provide suitable homes for Barn Owls, Tawny Owls, Little Owls & Kestrels.
We can delivery Nest Boxes to all areas of the UK or Nest Boxes can be picked up from the Centre as an option to save on the delivery charge, to arrange pick up you will need to call us first on 01452 383999.
England and Wales is a standard delivery cost, for all deliveries to Scotland and outer islands of mainland UK, please call us before placing an order as the courier cost for delivery will vary.
PLEASE NOTE : Please supply your contact telephone number when you place your order, this can be very useful if the courier becomes lost or if for some reason they have a problem finding the delivery address you have given.
Our courier can call you for directions if we struggle to find you; some properties are sometimes harder to find than others especially if they are in remote areas of the countryside. Our aim is to get the nest box to you.
If you need to contact us for any reason, this you can do at any time, including evenings, please note that we do operate a 24hr Rescue Centre too. For office hours, the best time to call is between 9am until 9pm, evenings are better though.
For more information click on the headings below.
For Barn Owls & Kestrels, position the box close to or within areas of rough grassland, this type of habitat contains the Barn Owls & Kestrels main prey source, which is Short tailed Voles, Field Mice & Shrews. For Tawny Owls & Little Owls, locate the box close to or within habitats above or in areas of mixed farmland with mature trees. If you have wooded habitat areas, this can be a preferred habitat location for the woodland Tawny Owl.
The best height to position the nest box is between 10ft to 16ft, make sure that the box is positioned securely & out of reach of people & out of reach of grazing animals.
With the porch fixed around the entrance hole, this allows the entrance of the nest box to be faced in any direction as it offers more protection from the weather. A nest box without an entrance porch simply allows driving rain & wind to enter.
The nest box & entrance hole should be made visible at a distance; this will enable the Owls to locate it. Please take into account any leaf foliage as this could grow over & obscure the entrance hole, do not hide the box from the Owl it is intended for. If an Owl was looking for a natural tree hollow, the hollow could be facing any direction & yet visible to an Owl, your nest box simply acts as a man made tree hollow so make its presence & entrance visible for the birds to get the best results.
To protect your own Nest Box project, please take into account the main dangers such as busy (A & B) roads & also live railway lines, fast traffic will kill Owls so please look at positioning a nest box well away from these dangerous areas. Also be aware of domestic pets if you are planning to position a Barn Owl nest box within a residential garden please call for advice before purchasing an Owl box.
Our nest boxes are large, spacious & most important they are built to last. Also they are designed to blend perfectly within the countryside.
This can be found inside the nest box when it arrives, to access the bracket, simply undo the four screws on the roof, your instructions will also be found inside when entering.
The small profit we generated from nest box sales help fund the conservation work of our charity in support of wild Owls.
As a charity, we have a great track record with all our customers, which includes many years of after sales support if required, this we feel we can guarantee & at no extra cost. Our aim is to help make your own projects as successful as ours.
Office hours are between 9am until 9pm, 7 days a week.
We normally always stock nest boxes because we need them to support the ongoing projects we are involved in. All boxes are made at the Barn Owl Centre's workshop by our team of Owl Conservationists.
The small amount of profit made from each nest box sale is of great importance to supporting the aims & objectives of our charity. For further information please read the below or call us, we are here to help.

The interesting history of it's owner follows. This would have belonged to Thomas Bruce the 7th Earl of Elgin and 11th earl of Kincardin, ambassador to the Ottoman empire and known for thereafter removing the statues of the Parthenon.
He'd also divorced his beautiful, equally interesting and somewhat unfaithful wife Mary (arranged marriage) that same year in 1807 , who among other indignities, was compeled to dress as a man to attend strictly segregated Ottoman ceremonies. It still carries the tags of an early fifth Avenue antique dealer. This fascinating piece of Georgian silver is very slightly. Bent at the tip, perhaps by marble?

Alisa Orduna in November 2015, just about a month before the Mayor‚Äôs BID Round Table on homelessness.

Mayor Garcetti is very committed to working with CCA and the other BIDS to develop homelessness policies and practices that address homelessness without unintentional harm to our business community. In the long run, we need businesses to provide pathways out of poverty through self-sustaining wages and pride in individual ability and skills.
The Idea : The core group of IInfrasol Services had a compelling vision to introduce IT Infrastructure advantages across various industry levels. They realized that small and medium businesses were hesitant to invest in technology due to the initial cost factor. These businesses were losing out on to competition in the long run due to lack of technology. This generated the idea to work closely towards a solution, which would bring in technology advantages to such businesses as well as keep cost well within reach.
Formation : The Promoters then aligned themselves to undertake various roles within the organization to make IInfrasol fully functional. Armed with technical expertise, certifications and a shared experience of above 45 man years, they reached out to Customers as well as Vendors to align the requirements of the industry. It was a win-win situation for everybody. From thereon, there was no looking back and today, IInfrasol Services is known as a tough competitor in IT Infrastructure Solutions and Services.

For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôve just confirmed the current behavior of the ‚ÄúUp/Menu‚Äù button on my own personal Fenix 5 (middle button on the left side of the watch), testing it within an app, as well as from the watch face/default watch screen. It behaves as follows, which I hope is what you would expect is the ‚Äúfixed‚Äù or correct behavior.
short-press: UP within an app.
long-press: Brings up MENU within that same app (did NOT bring up the Garmin system menu).
The only time I could get a long-press of the UP/Menu button to bring up the system menu was when the watch was in ‚Äúwatch face‚Äù mode, NOT running an app.
If you are able to somehow make the legacy Garmin app available for the Fenix 5 again, I‚Äôd be 1) incredibly grateful, and 2) happy to help with beta testing or feedback of any kind.
Oh, and I would also NOT expect any continued support or help with bugs, given that you‚Äôve already stated you‚Äôre moving away from the Garmin platform.
Thanks again for the excellent resource/platform that RaceQS provides!

SALISBURY‚ÄôS poor run of form continued with a surprise defeat at home to relegation threatened Gosport Borough.
Gosport, who before the game were without a win in sixth, and currently occupy the final relegation spot in the league, were the better side throughout the game, and it was they who looked like the team pushing for a favourable play-off spot.
A goalless first half saw chances for both sides ‚Äì Roberts had a good opportunity for Boro just after ten minutes from a corner after Whelan failed to track him, but volleyed over.
Another big huge chance came and went for the visitors.
A counter attack around the 20-minute mark left Sekajja one-on-one with Hallett about 8 yards out, and the forward should‚Äôve scored, only to be denied by Hallett to knock it wide.
The first half remained goalless, despite Fitchett hitting the crossbar in the 38th minute, and Gosport‚Äôs Lanahan was left unmarked for a free header, but was underneath it leaning backwards.
It sailed comfortably over the bar.
Shephard should‚Äôve put the Whites in front just before half time. A ball in behind the defence from Benson on the right hand set Fitchett free, who proceeded towards the goal. Strolling into the penalty area unmarked was Shephard.
Fitchett pulled it back, and Shephard proceeded to blast it miles over the bar. Salisbury‚Äôs best chance of the half and maybe the game.
Salisbury improved at the start of the second half but couldn‚Äôt find the net. Sparkes should‚Äôve scored with a golden chance just after the hour mark from the edge of the six yard box, but blasted his effort comfortably wide.
Moments later, a Wheeler foul gave Gosport a freekick in a very promising position, and captain Davis bent his effort over the wall and into the bottom corner, and Boro‚Äô took the lead.
A nightmare five minutes for Wheeler was compounded when a second yellow card saw the captain take an early bath ‚Äì the defender took down Pennery, who would‚Äôve been through on goal from a counter attack. It was a stonewall second yellow, and the Salisbury man can‚Äôt have any complaints about either booking.
Salisbury remained on the back foot for the closing periods of the game and took a deserved two-nil lead in extra time.
Despite some heroic saves from Hallett, Lanahan doubled his side‚Äôs lead.
It could be that this is what you want.
So cheap you could build a wall between you and the TV and slowly demolish it as you use the bricks as missiles.
I have often wanted to do that but with the TV and not the Laptop screen.
Better still is to throw something at the screen that will vent your spleen but not the screen.
Now on Ebay you can find the very thing as there are some traders that sell foam bricks for that very purpose.

Incubus rose to become one of the most popular alt-metal bands of the new millennium, setting themselves apart from a crowded field with a somewhat less-negative outlook and tireless touring. Formed in 1991 in the San Fernando Valley suburb of Calabasas, CA, group members Brandon Boyd (vocals, percussion), Mike Einziger (guitar), Alex Katunich (aka Dirk Lance; bass), and Jos√© Pasillas (drums) were all tenth grade classmates when they got together. Their early funk-metal sound was heavily influenced by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but broadened over the next few years to incorporate thrash, rap-metal, post-grunge rock, and grinding alt-metal √† la Korn or the Deftones. By the time the group graduated from high school, they had already been playing all-ages shows around southern California on a regular basis. In 1995, Incubus added hip-hop turntablist DJ Lyfe (aka Gavin Koppel) to their lineup and recorded the independently released album Fungus Amongus. That, coupled with their strong local following, helped the band get a deal with Epic subsidiary Immortal.
Incubus' first major-label release was the six-song EP Enjoy Incubus, which was released in early 1997 and consisted of previous demos that were revamped in the studio. Later in the year, their first full-length album, S.C.I.E.N.C.E., was released. Incubus hit the road with a vengeance, opening for bands like Korn, Primus, 311, Sublime, and Unwritten Law. By the summer of 1998, the band had amassed enough of a following to land a slot on that year's Ozzfest tour. They also wound up the year as part of Korn's inaugural Family Values tour, by which time DJ Lyfe had departed and been replaced by DJ Kilmore (first name Chris). With their momentum and exposure slowly building, Incubus returned to the studio and delivered their follow-up album, Make Yourself, in late 1999. The group went right back out on the road, and their stint on the 2000 Ozzfest helped crystallize the new audience that the single "Pardon Me" was pulling in. Although Make Yourself barely broke the Top 50 on the album charts, it was a steady seller that eventually pushed past the double-platinum mark. The second single, "Stellar," was a smaller-sized hit on rock radio, but the album's biggest song didn't hit the airwaves until 2001; "Drive" was a left-field success that became their first Top Ten hit on the pop charts. Incubus expanded their audience by playing Moby's Area: One package tour that summer, and with "Drive" still fresh in the public's mind, released their next album, Morning View, in the fall of 2001. It entered the charts at number two, confirming that Incubus had diligently worked themselves into stardom. "Wish You Were Here," "Nice to Know You," and "Warning" were all popular on rock radio, and the band naturally toured heavily in support -- this time as a headliner.
In early 2003, Incubus became embroiled in a contract dispute with Sony and filed a lawsuit to have their deal terminated under California labor laws. In April, the band announced the departure of bassist Dirk Lance. Within days, fellow Incubus guitarist Mike Eiziger called upon his Time Lapse Consortium mate Ben Kenney to be Lance's permanent replacement. The group remained a part of the Sony empire, however, and released A Crow Left of the Murder on Epic/Immortal in early 2004, which hit number two on the Billboard Top 200. Some touring followed before Incubus headed home in November to take a well-deserved break. The guys spent the next two years individually exploring things outside of the band -- music, art, film, and literature endeavors all included -- though they also remembered to work on and finish their sixth album, recorded over a year's time in both L.A. and Atlanta. The resulting record, Light Grenades, appeared in late November 2006.

In the same week that Imogen Murray, 24 from Leicestershire, is announced as a long list reserve for Equestrian Team GBR‚Äôs World Equestrian Games squad, she claimed victory in the CIC* class at Great Witchingham International in Norfolk.
It may come as a surprise to some that this is a first international win for the young rider who finished 11th at this year‚Äôs Mitsubishi Motor‚Äôs Badminton Horse Trials. With numerous National wins and International placings to her name, the win was seeming ever elusive.
‚ÄúA first International win seems a long time coming. We probably all assumed it would be with Fred (Wiseguy IV) or Charles (Ivar Gooden), as I came pretty close at Barbury with both of them, but Petal is an out and out superstar. She‚Äôll love being ‚Äòthe best horse on the yard'‚Äù commented Imogen.
Paired with the diminutive in nature but big in personality and scope, I‚Äôve Dun Talking, the pair jumped their way to victory in Saturday‚Äôs jumping phases, under the hot Norfolk sun. Despite having lead the feature International class with her second ride SJL Convince Me, after Friday‚Äôs dressage, the 14.2hh dun mare galloped ahead of her younger stable mate to claim the win.
I‚Äôve Dun Talking has gone from strength to strength this season, successfully finishing on her dressage score on each competitive appearance. Her first international victory follows swiftly on from a 3rd place finish in the competitive Keysoe Open Novice, and a 7th place in her first Intermediate at Aston-Le-Walls in May.
Imogen now heads to Barbury Castle International Horse Trials this week with three rides in the CIC** and Ivar Gooden, making his competitive return after his Badminton break, in the highly competitive Event Rider Masters CIC***.

For yet another example of the Bush administration‚Äôs war on science, take a look the Sunday New York Times today. It seems that James Hansen, a NASA climate scientist, has been talking a little bit too much about global warming. The White House wants him to cool it.
The party line apparently is that global warming is a myth, despite disturbing evidence that the average sea level globally has been steadily rising, indicating polar ice cap meltdown. (See this BBC article about rising sea levels for details.)The Daily Kos has a great commentary on the NYT article by DarkSyde, who seems to have an inside track on the allegations.
You might be hearing a lot of talk about the carnivore diet in the weight loss cliques as of late and one of the main reasons for that could very well be because of Dr. Shawn Baker. For those that haven't heard of this yet, it's basically what it sounds like, a diet that consists of just meat.
No fruits. No vegetables. No carbs. Just meat.
But before anything else, let's talk about Dr. Shawn Baker for a little bit. For those that do not know him, he's an advocate of "Zero Carb Eating" which is what the carnivore diet is. And outside of that, he's also an orthopedic surgeon and an athlete that holds INSANE indoor-rowing world records. Impressed yet?
In this episode, you‚Äôll hear the story behind how Dr. Shawn Baker got started on his journey of health problems to fixing it with major dietary changes. It involved going on a low carb diet to the ketogenic diet to finally finding his ideal diet of just meat. He then shares some of his thoughts on the studies and misconceptions about the carnivore diet that will shed some light into this relatively new lifestyle.
He also talks about how giving his patients more choices on their treatment caused him to lose his license as well as the many different western healthcare problems, World Carnivore Month in January, and more!
You'll definitely not want to miss this episode if you are keen to learn something new about losing weight and ways to improve your health through the carnivore diet. Now, let's get into the podcast!

Happy New Year to all of you. Last year was a terrific one personally and professionally for me. I hope that yours was as well and that 2015 will be even better.
I do not think you need to introduce God into the mix. This act is neither moral nor ethical because he is cheating his customers and profession at the same time. Morality, on the other hand, is what we would call a descriptive science. Your discussion regarding the definition, Ian, is well said and resonates with a major breakdown in our governance that has been a burr under my saddle for a long time and which no one ever talks about. It is difficult to hold a metaphorical mirror up to ourselves which can help us see our true selves. You make some good arguments but let me see if I can counter them to your satisfaction.
A proper understanding of ethics would solve a lot of problems. Your ethics are what makes you a good politician. Put simply, morals are the customs established by group of individuals whereas ethics defines the character of an individual. Life is a universal, objective value. Life is also a dual value ‚Äî we value our own life and the lives of others. And beyond a certain level of wealth, wealth accumulated by one person or group has the potential to harm the greater good. I also acknowledge here and in other sections that cultures are typically the arbiters of justice; they define what is right and wrong, and the people implicitly agree by their obedience to the rules.
A doctor is bound with the Hippocratic Oath which frames the structure of the working ethics of the medical world. Ethics is vital for a society because a society has ways of praising such behavior while at the same time reprimanding conducts that are against the ethical code of behavior. Ethics is innately knowable and requires introspection for greater understanding. Of course, not all religions are the same, some are more liberal than others and some more conservative, but in general, all religious traditions believe that their faith represents a path to enlightenment and salvation. The innate knowledge of ethics must have arisen after the formation of the planet earth. The income-tax recognized and exempts certain percentage of income-tax towards donation from the total income.
Is There A Difference Between Ethics And Morality In Business?
There is a fine line dividing the two. I see religion as a source of darkness, encouraging ignorance by answering questions with no answer; which retards curiosity in many to my amazement, not all. Respect for the universal life value sets us apart from our enemies. Morals refer to an individual's own principles regarding right and wrong. If you would prefer a physical copy, you can purchase To be honst,lotta philosophers and professors have failed to lay down a obvious line between the moral vs ethics. All three elements together conflict each other.
Change the tax structure, healthcare mandates, trade laws, transit spending‚Äîvirtually everything you do means someone will win, and someone will lose. Think of morals as deriving from the instincts that allow a young social mammal to survive long enough to become a full member of the group; and think of ethics as deriving from the instincts that make it possible for peers to work together efficiently. Choose one term and stick with it. Ethics are more a code of conduct set forward by the community. Individuals need to choose to be ethical in order for civil society to function properly. Wealthy and powerful people, by acting in concert and giving each other advantages at a personal level, can actually bend the overall playing field in a way a normal group of middle class friends cannot. And at what moment in the history of the world did this materialization occur? Ethical understanding is critically important, and so in math and science in the modern world.
My mind tends to lean in the direction of sweeping abstraction, but I think these abstraction make sense of a lot of concrete detail. Ethics deals with codes of conduct set my policies in the workplace and morality is the standards that we individually set for ourselves in regards to right and wrong. All culture needs to be continuously pruned; we need to keep the good and reject the bad. It sets our priorities in life, i. Now it may be that politicians to some extent do help out buddies because they are fond of them. I would also say that ethics transcend culture, religion, and time as well as being based on introspection. Maybe this will further the discussion in finding from sociology some basic commonly used terms.
The difference is that the ethos of a society or culture deals with its foundational philosophy, its concept of values, and its system of understanding how the world fits together. Here the lawyer knows that his client is and, if released on the charges, can repeat his crime. These three items are reducible, then can be viewed from an ethical perspective. Maybe the worlds philosophers should try working on more materialistic problems instead of these endless, and in the end, pointless arguments. His morals take a back seat as compared to his legal ethics.
It appears to me that the ultimate source of ethics is a belief in a higher power. It was burned to the ground by a group of ignorant and fearful Christians, responding to the power grab of a bishop at the time. His five now six moral pillars use the term morality, and three of these items are purely cultural. God is a powerful idea, but it is simply that. Flexibility Ethics are dependent on others for definition.
As I have said before, we are each of us two people, one social, one private. Citizens give the State authority over them, and this can be easily abused. Looking at Personal Freedom or Governmental Authority with a level of absolute sanctity for either is a problem. Information for this video gathered from The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy and more! We greatly encounter moral and ethical issues, in our day to day life. The state can use power memes of nationalism and authority to control people in the same way religion controls people with their memes. The law applies to all the citizens whether they want or not.
Ethics exists in the gray. Mankind has been laying the groundwork for its own self-imposed genocide for quite some time now with the advent of industrial civilization providing a significant amplifying effect in this conscious and unconscious endeavor. Conflicts Between Ethics and Morals One professional example of ethics conflicting with morals is the work of a defense attorney. Ultimately, the science of ethics is concerned with what is right, and morality is concerned with what is accepted. Some people talk about their personal ethics, others talk about a set of morals and everyone in a society is governed by the same set of laws. By questioning and thinking about God I came to understand the meme. You can be ethically minded and not equate fairness and equality; actually ethical understanding helps to avoid that problem.

How much will it cost to get your Private Pilots License?
That depends on how much time and effort you can dedicate to learning to fly. However, the cost of the aircraft and instructor can also make a big difference.
The FAA requires a minimum of 40 hours flight time for a private pilots license. At least 20 hours of that time must be with an instructor, the other 10 must be solo. Keep in mind the national average for getting a private pilots license is 70 hours. So we will assume it will take you 70 hrs of flight time and 50 hours of instruction (flight and ground).
As you can see getting your rating with the Flying 20 can save you a substantial amount of money! Please note this is a rough estimate, prices are subject to change and your own costs may vary.

A mouse study suggests that some Alzheimer‚Äôs symptoms are made worse by falling body temperature ‚Äî and are helped by improving body temperature.
A finding that Alzheimer's sufferers' failure to recognize familiar faces is rooted in an impairment in holistic perception rather than memory loss, suggests new strategies to help patients recognize their loved ones for longer.
A large long-running study adds to growing evidence that higher levels of physical activity reduce brain atrophy and Alzheimer's risk, and shows that many types of aerobic activity are beneficial.
A stress hormone has been found to be associated with more amyloid-beta protein, in mice and human neurons.
The finding helps explain why stress is a risk factor for Alzheimer's.
A previous 38-year study supports this with the finding that women who scored highly in "neuroticism" in middle age, had a greater chance of later developing Alzheimer's.
This link was largely accounted for by chronic stress experienced by these women over the four decades.
Comment on Christopher Warburton‚Äôs "Globalizing Sierra Leone"
Well written, Prof, but we need to put in place the necessary physical and social infrastructure for this globalising to be effective and sustainable.
That is what, I am convinced, the present regime is aiming to achieve in the next 5 to 10 years. After the placement of those structures, globalising will happen almost over night as the basic infrastructures, especially the cyber(IT) infrastructure, would have been in place.

In the first case of its kind involving the upcoming election, the Justice Department Friday announced that a Russian national has been charged with conspiracy to interfere in the U.S. political system, including the 2018 midterm election.
In a criminal complaint, authorities alleged that Khusyaynova, 44, of St. Petersburg, Russia, served as the chief accountant of ‚ÄúProject Lakhta,‚Äù a Russian umbrella effort funded by Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin and two companies he controls, Concord Management and Consulting LLC, and Concord Catering.
Authorities alleged that Khusyaynova managed the financing of Project Lakhta operations, including foreign influence activities directed at the United States.
The financial documents she controlled include detailed expenses for activities in the United States, such as expenditures for activists, advertisements on social media platforms, registration of domain names, the purchase of proxy servers and ‚Äúpromoting news postings on social networks,‚Äù the Justice Department alleged in a press release.
Between January 2016 and June 2018, Project Lakhta‚Äôs proposed operating budget totaled more than $35 million, although only a portion of these funds were directed at the United States, the Justice Department said. Between January and June 2018 alone, Project Lakhta‚Äôs proposed operating budget totaled more than $10 million.
Those involved, the Justice Department alleged, ‚Äútook extraordinary‚Äù steps to make it appear as if they were ordinary American political activists. This included the use of virtual private networks and other means to disguise their activities and to obfuscate their Russian origin.

SEAT's Toledo has long occupied an odd spot in the company's range, it sitting above the Leon, but being largely based on the same underpinnings. Previously that's meant a three-box shape (something it's reverted to), a familiar profile with bonnet, roof and boot, but with this third generation Toledo SEAT came over all MPV-esque, the Toledo going tall and mono-box, its looks and role much like its Altea relation. That might explain its relatively short production run, it only lasting a scant four years, SEAT's replacement reverting back to the familiar three-box layout.
Utilising Volkswagen Group underpinnings and powertrains means the SEAT Toledo was offered with much the same engine choices as you'll find in the Leon, Volkswagen Golf, Audi A3 and Skoda's Octavia. That means everything from 1.8-litre turbocharged petrol units, to a 170hp 2.0 TDI diesel. Forget both of those, as the Toledo was only ever sold in Ireland fitted with its more sensible powerplants. Scour the classifieds and you'll find little but 1.6-litre petrol engines or the ubiquitous 1.9 TDI unit on offer under the Toledo's bonnet.
That 1.6-litre petrol delivers 102hp and returns an average fuel consumption figure of 7.7 litres/100km; the 1.9-litre TDI delivers 105hp and an official combined fuel consumption figure of 5.4 litres/100km. The diesel is the quicker of the pairing, not thanks to its greater hp figure, but its greater torque, that making the TDI model an easier, punchier drive. That's particularly true if you've filled up the spacious cabin with passengers - something it's rather adept at doing. The diesel is additionally offered with a six-speed automatic gearbox, but it's a rare option, so don't hold your breath on finding one.
The Toledo's interior majors on SEAT's usual mix of simplicity and user friendliness. While the expansive black plastics on the dashboard are not quite up to the standard of its Volkswagen Group stable mates, that was always reflected in its price when new. All drive decently too, with reasonable handling for a family car and a comfortable ride.
It only survived on SEAT's price lists for four years, its position in the line-up rather negated by SEAT's own Altea XL, which brought all the passenger carrying utility and large boot space of the Toledo with lower purchase and running costs.
Choice is fairly limited, but you don't really need anything other than that 1.9-litre TDI diesel engine. The petrol is okay, but if you plan on filling it up with people, or venturing out of town on longer journeys, you'll be glad of the diesel's extra flexibility. All came generously specified as standard, so as a minimum you should expect to get air conditioning, remote central locking and alloy wheels among the standard equipment list.
Odd as this third generation Toledo might be its relative obscurity, mixed with decent practicality make it a useful family purchase on the used market. Only limited availability means there aren't many to choose from, but a 1.9 TDI engine for economy and performance with a middling specification could just make for the perfect, if unusual, family car.

The opening round of the season in Melbourne produced few technical upgrades, although most of what was brought to the final test session was intended for the opening races of 2015. Whilst we can expect a few more bits for Malaysia, this Technical Highlights post runs through a couple of the larger developments from the teams from the final Barcelona test and the minor detail changes made for Australia.
Melbourne confirmed what we realistically knew was going to occur for this year ‚Äì another season of dominance. The W06 looked better than every car out there even on Friday, when both drivers were struggling with the setup. Their advantage is to the tune of ~1.3s over a single lap and about 0.7s per lap in a race situation. For all we know they could have turned down the power unit for the race on Sunday!
As far as upgrades, the Silver Arrows had a subtle change to the nose which tapers more aggressively up to the specified point 150mm forward of the front wheel centreline before cutting diagonally downwards to meet the front bulkhead. The new shape encourages air passing along the side of the nose to duck underneath, head towards the splitter section and work the floor a little harder.
Although Red Bull already run the stub/short-tip nose, rumour is that they are producing one in the Williams form factor to increase overall downforce.
However this nose was not present in Australia as apparently it failed its crash test just before the race weekend. The stubbed noses are harder to pass the crash tests as they have a much shorter crumple zone to dissipate energy so expect nose developments to come around about China, if not Spain.
A late development to the RB11 in testing is this continuous leading edge rear wing endplate slot (red), which connects the horizontal louvres above the wing planes with the vertical slot at the front of the ‚Äòplate by the rear tyre.
As individual components, these slots act as pressure equalisers at their respective positions on the endplate: the horizontal louvres reduce the pressure gradient at the wing tips for better management of the vortices the wing sheds at speed, and the vertical slot cleans up turbulence generated by the rotating rear tyre.
Joined together, however, offers a better pressure distribution across the entire endplate rather than at localised points. This will have some implications on how the car produces its upwash effect at the rear but the main purpose of doing this conjoined slot is to reduce drag rather than gain downforce. It will be interesting to see if this catches on across the grid.
New since testing were some minor revisions to the front wing flaps. The upper-most flap has been cut more aggressively downards at the inboard region and the sixth element at the outboard edge of the wing now spans across it entirely. This adjustment is aimed at finetuning the Y250 vortex and increasing the efficiency of the wing at low/medium speed. Finally, the small flick-up vane behind the cascade winglets has been split into two elements for more precise management of airflow.
Lotus are still adjusting to life with Mercedes power, which ‚Äì combined with a decent aerodynamic overhaul on the new E23 ‚Äì means it could be a while before results from the new partnership come about.
Having run most of testing with botched bodywork in some minor areas, the complete rear brake duct assembly will have been a welcome gain for the team in Australia. Not only will this have improved brake temperature management but also some additional downforce downforce applied directly to the rear tyre.
The best thing about the start of the new season is that we finally get to see some pictures of the cars in the pitlane without bodywork on ‚Äì there are no hoardings for the teams to hide behind! We already knew that Williams and Force India were more than likely to retain their air-to-air intercooler (IC) layout from 2014 and Lotus have also followed this pathway for this year. I still find it pretty interesting that Mercedes are the only one to use an air-to-water IC of all the supplied teams.
The renewed McLaren-Honda continues to disappoint (for now), although their aero programme is beginning to show a few signs of improvement.
A number of new bits appeared across the MP4-30 including a neat pair of under-chassis vanes. These vanes are often updated to tweak the position of the Y250 vortex and manage airflow passing underneath the nose, so they have a profound effect on linking the front and rear aero structures. The new vanes have three curled elements, with upturned slots to entice airflow through them.
Work on the radically different front wing continued in Australia with plenty of flo-vis runs carried out during free practice. Both Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen tried two options, one with extended cascades and revised upper flaps, the other without (i.e. the testing wing).
At the rear the central rear wing has been extended through the engine cover and down onto the top of the gearbox case, effectively forming a Y-lon arrangement. Although this is heavier it will provide better structural stiffness to the rear wing and prevent unwanted flexing.
Seeing Ferrari near the top of the speed trap figures is a welcome change over their miserable 2014. Certainly the power unit is a major step in the right direction and the fact that Sauber are also up in the points despite only a few changes to their chassis justifies this.
A new front wing was brought to the final test, which they continue to use into the beginning of the season. James Allison‚Äôs design influence is starting to really show in this area whilst they have also borrowed a few design ideas from Mercedes.
The nose camera pods (1) are not as curved as the original test item following an FIA directive to make these more ‚Äúminimal‚Äù for 2015. Instead they form a vertical stalk and a nicely formed dog-leg onto the nose to manage airflow over the top of the chassis.
Having produced their own unique solution of the past few years, the cascade winglets (2) have stepped towards what most of the field is using today ‚Äì a twin element winglet accompanied by and r-shaped vane to turn airflow around the front tyre.
Also like other teams, a curved pressure gradient vane (3) has been placed on the wing‚Äôs endplate to generate a low pressure region behind and draw airflow from out behind the wing elements. This is not a very efficient way of producing downforce but it will help the outwash of airflow at the front of the car, which can be combined with the effect of the blown front axle.

slot game 100 free spinsÔºåtaboo! taboo!Now, if it were not conscious considerations like the really benevolent or neutral ones first mentioned above, it was certainly something akin to them, which had induced Pierre to return a straightforward, manly, and entire acceptance to his cousin of the offer of the house; thanking him, over and over, for his most supererogatory kindness concerning the pre-engagement of servants and so forth, and the setting in order of the silver and china; but reminding him, nevertheless, that he had overlooked all special mention of wines, and begged him to store the bins with a few of the very best brands. He would likewise be obliged, if he would personally purchase at a certain celebrated grocer's, a small bag of undoubted Mocha coffee; but Glen need not order it to be roasted or ground, because Pierre preferred that both those highly important and flavor-deciding operations should be performed instantaneously previous to the final boiling and serving. Nor did he say that he would pay for the wines and the Mocha; he contented himself with merely stating the remissness on the part of his cousin, and pointing out the best way of remedying it.For instance, there are some who say, that it is unjust to punish any one for the sake of example to others; that punishment is just, only when intended for the good of the sufferer himself. Others maintain the extreme reverse, contending that to punish persons who have attained years of discretion, for their own benefit, is despotism and injustice, since if the matter at issue is solely their own good, no one has a right to control their own judgment of it; but that they may justly be punished to prevent evil to others, this being an exercise of the legitimate right of self-defence. Mr. Owen, again, affirms that it is unjust to punish at all; for the criminal did not make his own character; his education, and the circumstances which surround him, have made him a criminal, and for these he is not responsible. All these opinions are extremely plausible; and so long as the question is argued as one of justice simply, without going down to the principles which lie under justice and are the source of its authority, I am unable to see how any of these reasoners can be refuted. For, in truth, every one of the three builds upon rules of justice confessedly true. The first appeals to the acknowledged injustice of singling out an individual, and making him a sacrifice, without his consent, for other people's benefit. The second relies on the acknowledged justice of self-defence, and the admitted injustice of forcing one person to conform to another's notions of what constitutes his good. The Owenite invokes the admitted principle, that it is unjust to punish any one for what he cannot help. Each is triumphant so long as he is not compelled to take into consideration any other maxims of justice than the one he has selected; but as soon as their several maxims are brought face to face, each disputant seems to have exactly as much to say for himself as the others. No one of them can carry out his own notion of justice without trampling upon another equally binding. These are difficulties; they have always been felt to be such; and many devices have been invented to turn rather than to overcome them. As a refuge from the last of the three, men imagined what they called the freedom of the will; fancying that they could not justify punishing a man whose will is in a thoroughly hateful state, unless it be supposed to have come into that state through no influence of anterior circumstances. To escape from the other difficulties, a favourite contrivance has been the fiction of a contract, whereby at some unknown period all the members of society engaged to obey the laws, and consented to be punished for any disobedience to them; thereby giving to their legislators the right, which it is assumed they would not otherwise have had, of punishing them, either for their own good or for that of society. This happy thought was considered to get rid of the whole difficulty, and to legitimate the infliction of punishment, in virtue of another received maxim of justice, volenti non fit injuria; that is not unjust which is done with the consent of the person who is supposed to be hurt by it. I need hardly remark, that even if the consent were not a mere fiction, this maxim is not superior in authority to the others which it is brought in to supersede. It is, on the contrary, an instructive specimen of the loose and irregular manner in which supposed principles of justice grow up. This particular one evidently came into use as a help to the coarse exigencies of courts of law, which are sometimes obliged to be content with very uncertain presumptions, on account of the greater evils which would often arise from any attempt on their part to cut finer. But even courts of law are not able to adhere consistently to the maxim, for they allow voluntary engagements to be set aside on the ground of fraud, and sometimes on that of mere mistake or misinformation.If practical trial is necessary to test the capabilities of Communism, it is no less required for those other forms of Socialism which recognize the difficulties of Communism and contrive means to surmount them. The principal of these is Fourierism, a system which, if only as a specimen of intellectual ingenuity, is highly worthy of the attention of any student, either of society or of the human mind. There is scarcely an objection or a difficulty which Fourier did not forsee, and against which he did not make provision beforehand by self-acting contrivances, grounded, however, upon a less high principle of distributive justice than that of Communism, since he admits inequalities of distribution and individual ownership of capital, but not the arbitrary disposal of it. The great problem which he grapples with is how to make labor attractive, since, if this could be done, the principal difficulty of Socialism would be overcome. He maintains that no kind of useful labor is necessarily or universally repugnant, unless either excessive in amount or devoid of the stimulus of companionship and emulation, or regarded by mankind with contempt. The workers in a Fourierist village are to class themselves spontaneously in groups, each group undertaking a different kind of work, and the same person may be a member not only of one group but of any number; a certain minimum having first been set apart for the subsistence of every member of the community, whether capable or not of labor, the society divides the remainder of the produce among the different groups, in such shares as it finds attract to each the amount of labor required, and no more; if there is too great a run upon particular groups it is a sign that those groups are over-remunerated relatively to others; if any are neglected their remuneration must be made higher. The share of produce assigned to each group is divided in fixed proportions among three elements‚Äïlabor, capital, and talent; the part assigned to talent being awarded by the suffrages of the group itself, and it is hoped that among the variety of human capacities all, or nearly all, will be qualified to excel in some group or other. The remuneration for capital is to be such as is found sufficient to induce savings from individual consumption, in order to increase the common stock to such point as is desired. The number and ingenuity of the contrivances for meeting minor difficulties, and getting rid of minor inconveniencies, is very remarkable. By means of these various provisions it is the expectation of Fourierists that the personal inducements to exertion for the public interest, instead of being taken away, would be made much greater than at present, since every increase of the service rendered would be much more certain of leading to increase of reward than it is now, when accidents of position have so much influence. The efficiency of labor, they therefore expect, would be unexampled, while the saving of labor would be prodigious, by diverting to useful occupations that which is now wasted on things useless or hurtful, and by dispensing with the vast number of superfluous distributors, the buying and selling for the whole community being managed by a single agency. The free choice of individuals as to their manner of life would be no further interfered with than would be necessary for gaining the full advantages of co-operation in the industrial operations. Altogether, the picture of a Fourierist community is both attractive in itself and requires less from common humanity than any other known system of Socialism; and it is much to be desired that the scheme should have that fair trial which alone can test the workableness of any new scheme of social life.
Since tech businesses have numerous functionalities, it‚Äôs not exactly wise to categorize them all into one batch when it comes to WordPress themes. However, that‚Äôs why so many theme developers have put together solutions that allow for the ultimate customization. Looking for a tech theme brings up some questions. Most notably, what should you look for in a technology theme? To start, all of the listings below are responsive, and they have lightweight builds with speed in mind. In addition, you‚Äôll find options for pricing tables, eCommerce, service listings and email collecting. Knowledge bases and forums are common for IT companies, while you‚Äôre always going to want at least the option of having a blog.
Who Might Find These Tech and Hosting Options Useful?
This one is a little obvious, but the whole point of these themes is to generate websites with modern looks and the functionality for selling and displaying products and services. Therefore, IT, hosting and tech businesses are the obvious choices when thinking about who might find the following themes useful. However, we must also think about some other companies like app developers, freelance designers, software companies and the many other brands that make up this space.
The Nucleus WordPress theme offers a solid start to this list because it‚Äôs a multipurpose theme. We say this because it‚Äôs often tricky trying to find the ultimate solution for all tech and IT companies. With Nucleus, you have the opportunity to design a website the way you want, but it also caters to the world of technology with certain design elements, icons and typography. First of all, you receive a wide range of premium integrations and plugins, such as the Master Slider plugin for showcasing deals, products and new services. The Visual Composer plugin is packaged in with your purchase for dragging and dropping elements on the backend, while the WooCommerce plugin goes well with the Nucleus theme if you‚Äôd like to start collecting money from customers.
With the Nucleus WordPress theme you get to start with six premade homepages, each of which enable you to begin your design without a blank slate. For example, one of them is for an app landing page showcase, while another works nicely for a startup landing page. The responsive design works well on all mobile devices, which is particularly important for boosting your SEO and giving tech customers a chance to contact you while they‚Äôre on the go. Each of the demos have their own little features and perks. For example, one of them is built for conferences and events. You gain access to a countdown timer, along with a module for listing off all of the speakers who are going to be at the event. Overall, the Nucleus WordPress theme is an impressive match for the tech world, with an impressive set of demos and features.
Try out the 3D Printing WordPress theme if you‚Äôre looking for both a responsive and elegant technology option. Although the developers say that it‚Äôs made for 3D printing companies, just about any type of business in the tech sector could have a go at this one. It all starts with the Visual Composer plugin, which allows you to drag and drop elements without touching a line of code. In addition, the Revolution slider plugin is there if you‚Äôd like to feature some image slides at the top of your site. The unique design comes with free updates throughout the life of your site, and you‚Äôll find that the wide and boxed width settings get you started with some simple customizations. The unlimited color presets are impressive, as they can certainly help out with branding.
Keep in mind that the 3D Printing theme allows for an online store, so if you‚Äôd like to sell and collect money for your products, it‚Äôs all done through the theme and potentially an eCommerce plugin like WooCommerce. A parallax effect is prominent in the background, so when a user scrolls down on the page they see the slow movements of your backgrounds to keep the eyes on the most important content. Along with a contact form, the 3D Printing theme comes with a beautiful gallery/portfolio. We like this particularly for those companies that need to show off their past work, since the thumbnail imagery is enough to convince potential clients. As a final note, the theme provides some impressive blog layouts and demo content. This way you don‚Äôt need to worry about starting from scratch, and the design process will be that much faster.
Consider the Arlo Tech & Digital Business Theme if you‚Äôre interested in a fresh look for your technology business. The multipurpose option gives you an impressive number of demos to get your feet wet, while the gradient slider is pretty easy to manage when you have announcements that all of your site visitors should see. This is a full responsive theme for the best viewing experience on all devices, and the interactive dots background effect is sure to bring eyes to the content that matters most. You get to use the Visual Composer editor plugin, which is by far the best solution on the market. No coding is required, which is particularly useful for beginners with no coding experience. Not to mention, the WooCommerce plugin combines well with the Arlo Tech & Digital Business Theme, turning your site into a beautiful online store.
There are some parallax effects that we‚Äôve noticed on the demo, so if you‚Äôd like that to occur on your header then you shouldn‚Äôt have any problems at all. In addition, the header/slider provides a simple overlaying button and text module, which we enjoy for announcing new products or inserting a call to action. Since you get so many demos with the Arlo Tech & Digital Business Theme, we would like to outline just a few of them. For example, one of them is built just for a product showcase. Another demo has the functionality for displaying your app and getting people to download it. Some of the other demos include a Vcard, portfolio, portfolio with parallax effect, a simple business demo and more. It‚Äôs a solid theme for quite a few business types out there, so give it a try.
The ProHost WordPress theme delivers an impressive number of features for hosting companies. The modern and functional option provides lots of shortcodes for you to play around with. For example, if you‚Äôd like to insert a button or column on your homepage, you generally only have to grab a shortcode, eliminating the need to create your own custom CSS. The Visual Composer is yet another handy tool for optimizing your website and speeding up the development process. This is a fully responsive theme that looks just wonderful on tablets, phones and computers. This functionality is only going to help you out with the search engines, and we‚Äôre certain your customers will find it pleasing to the eye as well. The two homepage layouts are rather similar to what you would see on any hosting site, with a slider and large call to actions that announce what the hosting pricing looks like. You‚Äôll also find a spot to show pricing plans, for when people would like to signup.
The translation options are rather useful as well, considering so many of the customers that come in for a hosting company are not necessarily going to speak English. Along with that, the ProHost WordPress theme boasts a unique media content manager for when companies need to keep track of imagery and make sure it‚Äôs always the right size. WooCommerce also combines nicely with the theme, allowing for you to collect payments from customers who want hosting from you. We talked about shortcodes a little bit above, but the true outlying feature comes in the form of a shortcode builder, which is handy for when you need to create a somewhat unique webpage element without generating your own custom CSS. For example, image formatting and buttons are generally possible through a shortcode builder.
The Future 16 WordPress theme enables you to get your digital technology business off the ground. It comes with the Revolution Slider plugin, and all of the elements on the website looks wonderful on mobile devices. The drag and drop page builder is enough to speed up the development process for both beginners and advanced users, while the unlimited color and background solutions are essential when trying to brand your site and turn it into something a little more unique. The responsive design looks nice on all devices, and you‚Äôre bound to love the WooCommerce integration, since it‚Äôs just about the easiest plugin implementation you‚Äôll stumble upon.
Overall, the Future 16 WordPress theme has quite a bit to offer. Along with a modern design, shortcode generator and several custom widgets for placing in your footer, it‚Äôs one of the broader themes that any tech company could work with.
You can‚Äôt create tech websites by following the conventional approach. Rather, you need specialized templates like IT company for developing fully featured IT and technology sites. As the theme supports several post types and formats, you can publish different types of content. The powerful admin panel includes the necessary options to control the appearance.
The WPML-certified template is perfect for multilingual IT sites. There are lots of shortcodes for creating different elements. The custom widgets will be useful for building the sidebar and footer sections. Since you will get lifetime updates, there‚Äôs no need to worry about the functionality and compatibility in the future.
The clean, modern design of Endeavor makes it a great choice for developing IT company websites. There are more than 50 different widget positions to help you create any layout you want. You can use both photos and videos in the integrated full-screen slider. The real-time customizer allows you to make various changes and check out the output at the same time.
You can choose any of the five built-in color schemes or create your own. As the template comes pre-packaged with the ‚ÄúComing Soon‚Äù and 404 pages, you won‚Äôt have to create these from scratch.

Spring is an excellent time to clean and repair pool fences, ensuring they are in a tip-top condition before summer.
Not only do you want your pool fence to look great, you also want to be certain there aren‚Äôt any potential problems that relate to safety, like broken latches or upright posts that have rotted or been unseated or have become misaligned.
Swimming pool fences are manufactured from the full range of fencing materials including wood, PVC, metal, and chain link. Irrespective of the material used, the design and manufacture must comply with state, county, and/or local authority laws, by-laws, and regulations. These are designed to prevent children, animals, and non-swimmers from gaining access to pools when they aren‚Äôt in use. Most importantly, if the design incorporates horizontal slats, these must not form a ‚Äúladder‚Äù that anyone could use to climb over the fence.
In Georgia, residential pool fences must be at least 4 foot high and no more than 4 inches off the ground. Openings must not be any bigger than 4 inches in diameter, and gaps between vertical slats may not be wider than 1¬º inches. Chain link fencing may not have openings that are larger than 1¬º square inches. Horizontal slats must be at least 45 inches apart or on the pool side of the fencing.
Gates must open outwards and must be both self-closing and self-latching.
If repairs are necessary, it is essential that the approved design is maintained. For instance, if upright posts are leaning out of alignment, you can‚Äôt just brace these with additional horizontal rails. If the latch doesn‚Äôt close properly it will need to be replaced.
A good spring clean should start with a thorough examination of the fencing. Look for dirt and fungal or algae growth as well as structural damage.
Mold and algae are more likely to form on painted or vinyl surfaces. Remove with a household detergent or proprietary cleaner.
Mud and sand can be hosed off. Do this before checking for wear and tear or damage.
Check wooden posts for rot just above ground level. If the post isn‚Äôt absolutely firmly embedded, and moves when pushed, there might be rot below the surface of the ground. This will require urgent action, although you might be able to replace just the rotten part and bolt and brace a shorter post to the bottom of the old one.
Check the alignment of posts using a spirit level to make sure they are still plumb and square. Wind, frost, and unstable or very soft soil can all affect posts over time. The state of any badly aligned posts will determine whether they need to be replaced or simply reset in concrete.
Check for loose rails and siding. If the fence is covered with plants, make sure that shoots, tendrils, and even small branches haven‚Äôt started to work their way into the fence structure. Again, it may be possible to repair some elements while others might need to be replaced.
If the fence is painted check for bubbles, blisters, and peeling paint. These sections should be scraped and then patched with new paint. If a painted pool fence has been allowed to deteriorate, the whole structure may need to be stripped and repainted.
Wooden fences that have been stained and/or sealed should be resealed annually.
Check metal fences for rust. This can usually be scraped, sanded, or removed with a commercial product. These areas should be recoated with a rust-resistant finish.
Check chain link fences for holes or other damage.
If you maintain your pool fence regularly, chances are there will only be minor cleaning and repair work required this spring. But sometimes major repair work is needed, in which case call the Georgia-based Natural Enclosures Fence Company for advice and a free quote!
Alfred Barnard was the author of a four-volume work entitled Noted Breweries of Great Britain and Ireland, (1889-91). He conducted his research by visiting each of the breweries and seeing at first hand how work was carried out. Barnard was particularly excited to start his tour of breweries with Guinness‚Äôs which he describes as ‚Äòthe largest and most renowned brewery in Europe‚Äô. Over a period of ten days he ‚Äòwitnessed on a grand scale, the manipulation of malt, and its manufacture into porter‚Äô.
Seven chapters of Barnard‚Äôs work are devoted to the Guinness Brewery, suggesting its importance in the worldwide brewing industry. Indeed, writing in 1889, Barnard commented that ‚Äòthe business is now the largest in the world, and the buildings in which it is carried on cover nearly forty-two acres of ground.‚Äô At the time of Barnard‚Äôs visit to the brewery, Claude Guinness was the Managing Director.
The overwhelming picture is one of a company that had been an international player since 1825, was at the cutting edge of the brewing industry and employed a vast number of staff. According to Barnard, ‚ÄòThe average number of hands employed in the establishment, which besides labourers, artisans, brewers, maltmen and engineers, includes clerks and managers of departments, is 2,650 persons, representing the working inhabitants of a town with a population of upwards of 6,000.‚Äô Therefore a huge percentage of the Dublin population was employed at the brewery.
The team at Guinness‚Äôs demonstrated a paternalistic approach towards its employees, something which is still remembered to this day. Barnard describes Belview and Rialto, two villages that were erected by Messrs. Guinness & Co. for their workmen. The populations were ‚Äòupwards of 350 persons‚Äô and ‚Äòupwards of 400 persons‚Äô respectively. The standard of living in these villages was very good for the time.
Likewise, the families of the Guinness workers tended to be well looked after. ‚ÄòWe were informed that all sorts of benefit and building clubs are well supported by the men, and that good provision is also made for them by the company in case of sickness, and to the widows after their husbands‚Äô death‚Äô. Being a worker at the Guinness Brewery was considered to be an honour.
Two types of porter were created in the brewery: plain porter (single stout) which Barnard equated to London porter, and double stout which in England was known as bottled stout. The raw materials used water included water, barley, hops and yeast. The water used to make the stout was the moderately hard water from the Grand Canal. (The softer water from Dublin‚Äôs other water supply, the river Vartry, was better suited for boilers and other processes). While some of the barley used in the brewing process was from Ireland, Guinness‚Äôs also imported barley from England, Scotland and elsewhere. The majority of hops were sourced from Kent in England but some were also imported from Germany and America.
Barnard explains in some depth the various processes and machinery used. He was particularly impressed with Guinness‚Äôs narrow-gauge railway system, commenced in 1873 and completed in 1877. Barley was delivered by train to the malt-houses where malting would be carried out between the months of September and May. Once the barley had been steeped, floored and kiln dried, the resulting malt would be emptied into the railway‚Äôs malt wagons and transported to the malt stores at St. James‚Äô Gate. When required by the mills, the malt transported from the stores to the mills by rail, as were the finished product ‚Äì the casks of stout ‚Äì which were delivered to Victoria Quay where they would be offloaded onto barges. Empty casks were also offloaded from barges by crane and loaded onto the railway wagons.
In all, Barnard devotes over forty pages to his description of the Guinness Brewery as it was in 1889, which is of interest to anyone researching the history of the St. James‚Äô Gate Brewery, brewing in general or anyone who may have had a family member working there. There are also a number of black and white illustrations (some of which have been included in this article) which complement his descriptions.
If you‚Äôd like to find out more about Barnard‚Äôs Noted Breweries of Great Britain and Ireland, (1889-91) a detailed description can be found at the Eneclann online shop, where it is for sale on fully searchable CD-rom.
‚ÄôTis the season to buy and exchange not only books but also the kind of book-related tat and ephemera ‚Äì including Penguin mugs, bookshop T-shirts, tote bags, typewriter-key jewellery, Jane Austen notelets and novelty socks ‚Äì that at any other time of the year you wouldn‚Äôt consider giving house room to.
Pre-eminent this year among the items that you will soon to be regifting or taking to the Save the Children shop is The Grumpy Guide to Life: Observations from Grumpy Cat (Chronicle). Grumpy Cat is ‚Äì of course ‚Äì an internet sensation. And she is, just in case you haven‚Äôt been paying enough attention to Reddit, Facebook and all of the other contemporary heralds and signs of wonder ‚Äì a grumpy-looking cat. There‚Äôs a movie, apparently ‚Äì beware! ‚Äì and a lot of merchandise. The book consists of Grumpy Cat looking grumpy, with captions offering hilarious demotivational advice. ‚ÄúStrangers Are Just Enemies You Haven‚Äôt Met Yet‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Longest Journeys Start with a Single Step. Best Not to Take Any‚Äù etc. I was about to throw the book in the bin, despairing entirely of the state of modern civilisation, when my children pointed out that I look and sound exactly like Grumpy Cat. So at least I know what I‚Äôm getting for Christmas.
For anyone who attempts to offload Grumpy Cat on you, it would be easy to retaliate with something like Rick Chillot‚Äôs How to Make Your Baby an Internet Celebrity (Quirk), or perhaps Andy Donaldson‚Äôs Terrible Estate Agent Photos (Square Peg). Don‚Äôt ‚Äì although the latter does have the obvious advantage of being actually funny and wins hands‚Äëdown the toilet book captions-of-the-year competition.
2014 will of course be remembered as the year that saw the Russian intervention in Ukraine, the rise of Islamic State in Iraq, terrible events in Syria and Ebola in west Africa. It will also doubtless be remembered as the year in which we reached peak beard. It is therefore perhaps a little too late for the British Library to be offering a reprint of Thomas S Gowing‚Äôs The Philosophy of Beards, first published in 1854, but the book might serve as a nice memento for some recently clean-shaven hipster.
As they rediscover their newly hair‚Äëless chin the hipster in your life might enjoy a couple of literary chin‚Äëstrokers, such as The Biographical Dictionary of Literary Failure, edited by CD Rose (Melville House), and Haruki Murakami‚Äôs The Strange Library, first published in Japan in 2008 and now translated into English for the first time (Harvill Secker). It‚Äôs difficult to make head or tail of either of these books, which are therefore guaranteed to last until Boxing Day and beyond. Even more delightfully perplexing is Hans Eijkelboom‚Äôs People of the Twenty-First Century (Phaidon), which features page after page of themed photographs ‚Äì a page of men in Cairo wearing stripey jumpers, for example, women in Nairobi wearing floral prints, and men in New York wearing T-shirts. A kind of Where‚Äôs Wally? for adults, minus Wally.
Speaking of which, anytime is of course a good time to read a Terry Pratchett, but it‚Äôs perhaps only at Christmas that one might one indulge in a collection of essays such as Jacob M Held and James South‚Äôs Philosophy and Terry Pratchett (Palgrave). Who could resist a book that includes an essay on ‚ÄúCapitalism, Socialism, and Democracy on the Discworld‚Äù? Other inexplicably irresistible and uncategorisable Christmas fare includes Reggie Chamberlain-King‚Äôs Weird Belfast (Blackstaff), a compendium of weird facts about a city that might rightly claim to be weirder than any other, and Mel Gooding‚Äôs Art Rules! (and How to Break Them) (Redstone). Don‚Äôt buy these books as gifts: keep them for yourself. Ditto the gorgeous book bags, hoodies, badges and goodness knows what else available from all of the remaining independent bookshops up and down the country, such as NoAlibis (noalibis.com), the Book Hive (thebookhive.co.uk) and Much Ado Books (muchadobooks.com).
Finally, as one considers yet another pointless and wasted year, it might be time to consider giving it all up and joining the new age travellers who are beautifully portrayed in Iain McKell‚Äôs The New Gypsies (Prestel). If Jesus really was born in a stable, he‚Äôd have been right at home among the wild-eyed and the dentally challenged people photographed by McKell. He would also doubtless have identified with the many neglected, overlooked and forgotten people in Jenny Volvovski, Julia Rothman and Matt Lamothe‚Äôs The Who, the What and The When (Chronicle), which is an account of the lives of the friends, mentors, mothers, brothers, aunts, sidekicks and also-rans of history. Spare a thought for Jack Sendak, brother of the more famous Maurice, for Tom Thumb‚Äôs wife and for the Carter Family‚Äôs guitar teacher. We can‚Äôt all be Andy Warhol, but we may yet be a Julia Warhola. Personally, I‚Äôd rather be Emily Dickinson‚Äôs dog than Grumpy Cat.
About a month ago the hubby and I decided to rent a storage space for all the stuff we just can't seem to part with but have no actual use for. Well, we started separating everything and deciding on what would stay and go and in the process JD's room became the dumping ground for everything; my hubby's old nursing books, clothes for donation, outgrown toys, boxes and laundry. I couldn't believe that a room that was once so organized and peaceful, now looked like a tornado had hit it. So last weekend I finally couldn't take it anymore and spent two days getting everything back to normal, including finally putting JD's crib back in his room (he's never actually slept in his own room until now). I thought twice about posting these pictures because honestly they are pretty embarrassing, but I think they're a great way to ensure we never let it get that bad again and best of all, now I can start working on Robot Decor!
It was, but I do feel so much better, I would literally cringe every time I passed by that room! When JD saw it he was so excited to finally get to play in his own room again!
Looks great! It's all nice and neat!

Although I didn‚Äôt manage to get good shots of the Harlequin Ducks at Ft. Flagler due to the heavy fog, I did get some great shots of them after we stopped for lunch and some store-hopping in Port Townsend. Although I‚Äôve gotten better shots once or twice when I could get closer to them, the lighting was as good as I‚Äôve ever seen, with the sun breaking over my shoulder for a change. Though wary, the ducks were obviously used to people and went about catching food with only an occasional glance back at us.
even though the white patch on the male is too white, lacking details.
When I zoomed in on the male, the exposure was much better, even showing some of the small feathers behind the bill.
not to mention a chance to get slightly different profiles of the two males.
just because it‚Äôs not quite as beautiful as the picture next to it.
Truly beautiful images of such a stunning bird. I‚Äôve never seen a Harlequin, and these photos really give me a deep sense of what one looks like.
Recently I made a decision to update the laser computers from XP to Windows 7 (and update to X5 and wireless network while I was at it).
I'm not a complete stranger to upgrading and updating computers so I expected the process (for 2 computers) to take a day at max, and arranged the workflow to suit.
The Microsoft info. on upgrading assured me that the Windows Easy Transfer (WET) procedure would make the whole process quick and simple, and all I needed was a largish thumb drive.
After buying software I was ready to go. The WET file on comp 1 was 7 gig (!) and I started the transfer. Unfortunately the time required for the transfer to the thumb drive was calculated to be 7 and a half hours... This has rather blown my schedule. Comp 2 indicated 8.2 gig and 8 hours. A trip to a computer shop was undertaken and another drive obtained so that at least they could both be transferring at the same time. When I left work both drives were still transferring merrily (both are USB2 by the way) and had finished when I arrived the next morning.
It's now time to load software and the whole process went quite well. Updates downloaded (huge), Corel and Photoshop etc, printer drivers, email programs, registrations - time consuming, but all good.
The only problem was that WET failed miserably on both comps. A Google search indicated that this is not uncommon, and pointed to a couple of unofficial (and unsupported) MS workarounds that are amazingly complicated and have only a limited chance of success. Fortunately I had separate backups of around 10,000 Corel and Photoshop files, but more recent files were missing and emails and settings just disappeared. I really didn't think that I needed to bother doing a further backup because WET would take care of it.
If anybody here is thinking of upgrading to Windows 7 I would strongly recommend a full backup of everything, as well as totally ignoring the WET option.
While it wouldn't solve the problem of WET cocking up your systems, you would have saved a lot of time if you went with one of those USB hard drive docks (they usually go for about $30, I even got one free with the purchase of a hard drive). The Flash drive is great if the files to be transferred were large (like CAB files), but every time Windows transfers a small file (think of all of the txt, bat, lnk, tmb thumbnail files, etc.), it has to read a partially filled data sector from Flash, add the new small file, erase that Flash sector, then write in the updated sector... windows isn't smart enough to bundle up a bunch of small files and write a full sector in one shot.
Want proof? Zip up about 500 megs worth of files and drag the one file onto the drive. Time it. Now find a bunch of small files (say 1,000 or more) that make up about 500 megs combined and drag those over... you'll be waiting a while. I learned long ago to zip everything into one file if I'm trying to transfer between machines.
Including inside placed components 6000Kg so over all Container weight 6000Kg.
Now at the time of lifting Container ISO corners should be contact with lifting hook.
My aim is in lifting condition i want to find the Stress and deformation on ISO corners and structure behavior also.

And here i was given 2G 3G acceleration upwards because i think at lifting condition container feel some jerking moment so i given this 2G and 3G.is this correct ???
I don‚Äôt want to be that person. Or rather I don‚Äôt want to be seen as that person. Because I am not. Even saying grains makes me feel pretentious.
Maybe it‚Äôs just because I want to eat a cookie. Or maybe it‚Äôs because I know how bad it made me feel when people suggested I cut out gluten instead of taking my medication. Maybe that‚Äôs the person I am truly afraid of. It‚Äôs the same people that assume I am diabetic because I am overweight (I am not diabetic, it‚Äôs just an assumption.) Or a flake, instead of anxious. Or dramatic, instead of sensitive.
It‚Äôs about culpability. They don‚Äôt want you to skate on all the things you have done, the way you let yourself go, the deadlines you have missed, or the projects you‚Äôve abandoned. If gluten is to blame, then so are you. Because you don‚Äôt have the will power to stop. Which comes back to personal responsibility and the dreaded ‚Äúfomo,‚Äù or fear-of-missing-out. If I can claim bankruptcy on my failings, then why can‚Äôt they? Why am I getting a get out of jail free card when they can‚Äôt. Of course, what they don‚Äôt get is when you are mentally ill you never get out of jail. Never.
Personally I would love to be ‚Äúout of my mind.‚Äù I want that kind of crazy. I would love that kind of crazy. This kind of crazy‚Ä¶ this kind of crazy is like being chained to the worst version of yourself. And every time you feel free of it, she drags you back in.
But also the cookie. I really, really want a cookie.
Update: I ate the cookie. It wasn‚Äôt that great. So I stopped at just one. Progress.

Karachi, Pakistan - On the evening of April 24, 2015, Sabeen Mahmud, the director of The Second Floor, a beloved cafe and communal space in Karachi, was shot and killed.
Mahmud's murder, and the resounding question of who was responsible, made news within and outside Pakistan. Less than a month later, the authorities announced that they had a culprit: a 27-year-old man named Saad Aziz.
He was "a burger kid", explained one unnamed friend interviewed by the Pakistani newspaper The Express Tribune at the time of Aziz's arrest. "He was funny, acted in plays and danced."
In Pakistan, the label "burger kid" is a loaded one.
"The implications of being a 'burger' are that you are spoiled, and detached from what is going on in the country," says Monis Rahman, 45, the founder of Rozee.pk, Pakistan's biggest online jobs portal.
"A burger lives in a cocoon and is enamoured by things outside of Pakistan - by the West," Rahman explains. The word is often used to describe well-to-do Pakistanis who may have American or British-tinged accents after years spent studying or working outside Pakistan, he says.
"Fully dressed with matching accessories even for 8am classes at university, they always own the latest in fashion, cars and gadgets," is another definition suggested by The Express Tribune. "Their 'parties' mimic nightclubs in foreign countries since the poor souls don't have any clubs here and have to recreate the experience on their own."
"People who have stronger English-speaking skills and more international exposure are valued higher in the jobs market."
Since 2013, there has been a slow but steady evolution of the term "burger" beyond its pejorative context.
Former cricketer Imran Khan, the leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, was dismissed as a "baby boy or a burger boy" by older political leaders, while his supporters were called "burgers".
"It's the first time that the burger group will also come out to vote," quipped politician Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed before the elections in May 2013.
"They're going to join the chapati-and-salan [curry] folk. They might need to carry their laptops on their heads to protect them from the sun."
While Rasheed hinted that PTI supporters were more suited to campaigning on social media from the comfort of their homes, he made one crucial point: "If they do come out to vote, they'll do amazingly well."
An estimated 46.2 million people voted in these elections, compared with the 36.6 million voters from the previous 2008 elections. The 2013 election saw the highest voter turnout in Pakistan's history. Thirteen million were first-time voters and more than half the registered voters were aged 18-29.
Rasheed was proved right. Khan's base of young, educated urban "burgers" helped the PTI to emerge from the elections as the second most powerful political party in the country. With 7.7 million votes, the PTI knocked President Asif Ali Zardari's party, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), which garnered 6.9 million votes, from its perch and into third place.
PTI's burgers began to wear the label with pride; literally, in some cases, as the party's supporters turned up at rallies and on election day wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the words "Kaptaan's Burger Army" ("Kaptaan" is a moniker that pays tribute to Khan's time as captain of the Pakistani cricket team).
Originally from Lucknow in pre-partition India, Raza spent several years after partition in 1947 working in the Middle East.
Although he knew no one in Karachi when he arrived, his son, Ashfaq Raza, 53, says: "My father dreamed of starting up a business that would ensure people would know of us and know our family's name."
As his nine sons moved to the United States and England for their studies, Musa Raza, who is no longer alive, urged them to return to Karachi as soon as they could to start up a business.
Ashfaq's older brother, Iqbal, a flight engineer, travelled frequently to Europe and witnessed the arrival of McDonald's there in the 1970s. "He saw the long lines outside McDonald's restaurants and hit upon the idea of bringing the franchise to Pakistan," Raza says.
In 1978, the brothers approached the McDonald's corporation. They were promptly turned down. "They told us that Pakistan was not ready for burgers," Raza recalls.
They made an offer to Burger King who gave them the same answer.
"So we took that as a challenge," Raza explains. "We wanted to prove these multimillion-dollar chains wrong."
To learn the ropes, the brothers spent a few months working at a McDonald's near their family home in Hartford, Connecticut. At one point, Raza and five of his brothers worked at the same outlet.
Their colleagues did not know that they were there to soak up all the information they could about running a fast food enterprise.
"We even offered to work for no pay," says Raza, who spent three months at McDonald's while in high school.
The brothers were paid $1.80 an hour and worked their way up from cleaning the restrooms to learning to make the food, handle equipment and manage staff. In late 1978, the Raza brothers returned to Karachi and began testing burger recipes.
"Our friends warned us that this was a bad idea," Raza says. "At that time, there were no burgers in Pakistan - just bun kebabs." The bun kebab, a local variant of the burger, consists of a slender minced meat patty and a potato or lentil patty. Slapped inside a bun and garnished with a fried egg, onions, chillies and chutney, the bun kebab is a staple at roadside cafes or street vendors' carts and is gulped down in three or four bites. But the brothers didn't want to make what Raza refers to as this "poor man's burger".
"I'm sure many people told McDonald's in the 1950s that American households weren't interested in what they had to offer," Raza says. "But McDonald's changed the game. That's what we wanted to do - change the model of how and what people ate in Pakistan."
They spent three months perfecting a tender beef patty with a peppery spice and the slightly sweet "secret sauce" that cut out the need for what Raza calls "frills", like tomatoes or onions.
In the following months, the brothers laid down the foundation for Pakistan's first burger joint, and created a blueprint that would be replicated in hundreds of fast-food outlets in the country for years to come, its simplicity belying the mammoth task of creating an entirely novel approach to eating out.
The brothers were determined to source all the food products locally - this was to be a proudly Pakistani enterprise - and so while equipment had to be brought in from the US, everything from ketchup to straws and paper ramekins for sauce had to be made in the country.
"You won't believe it, but at that time, there was only one supplier in the country who made disposable cups, and it was selling them to the national airline only," Raza recalls. "They refused to sell the cups to us because they didn't think it was worthwhile and they didn't understand what we were trying to do." It took the family five years to convince the company to produce the 16-ounce cups Mr Burger needed.
Following the McDonald's model, the Raza brothers wanted to hire students to work at the outlet. But they did not anticipate the stigma associated with working in a kitchen.
"Kids from Karachi were embarrassed about getting a job at a restaurant and, moreover, they didn't want to do basic chores like cleaning the floor," Raza says.
Some employees would appeal to Raza - "I'm a Syed [families believed to be direct descendants of the Prophet Muhammad], how can I mop the floor?" Raza laughs at the memory now. "They didn't realise I am a Syed as well. I cleaned the floors and tables for two years until the employees came around to it."
One year later all that remained to be decided was the name. "There used to be a restaurant in Hartford named Mr Steak," Raza recalls. "When we were trying to come up with a name for our business, that name clicked."
And so, Mr Burger was born. "It was simple, easy to remember and whether someone was educated or not, it was easy to pronounce," Raza says.
His brother Iqbal, the flight engineer, travelled to Paris frequently and after the name was settled, he strolled down the Champs-Elysees and found an artist who sketched a logo for the business.
In 1980, the Raza brothers opened the doors of the first Mr Burger in Karachi's Nazimabad neighbourhood. They served five kinds of burgers - Mr Burger, Beef Burger, Chicken Burger, Egg Burger and Veggie Burger - for five rupees each (five cents today), French fries (Rs2) and flavoured slush (Rs2 a cup). The prices ensured that even students on shoestring budgets could buy a meal of fries and slush.
"Within minutes we had nearly 150 people crammed into this tiny space," Raza recalls. "People in the neighbourhood had been watching as the restaurant was being constructed and they were so curious about what we were selling that we didn't even need to advertise our opening - the news just spread through word of mouth."
The brothers did not just introduce a new food to Pakistani consumers - they served up the fast-food culture that they had seen in the US, one that a majority of Pakistanis had never been exposed to as international travel was a privilege reserved for the rich.
While some customers were annoyed that the restaurant only served burgers - "You won't believe how many people asked us why we didn't have nihari or biryani on the menu," Raza says - others wanted a taste of this "American food".
"They wanted to try it, but they were confused about how to eat a burger," Raza says. "Some would pick it apart and then use the bun as roti to scoop up bites of the patty." Raza and his brothers would then demonstrate how to unwrap the burger's paper covering, and pull it down halfway to form a pocket while eating.
Customers would sit at a table and holler at servers to bring their food over or get angry that they weren't being waited on, he recalls. "They had no clue about self-service, takeaway food or disposable items - people returned wrappers and cups to us until they learned they could throw leftovers in the trash."
Mr Burger's "no smoking policy" was an alien concept too. At the time, there was a marked shift in attitude towards more gun-toting as AK-47s, brought by Afghan refugees fleeing the Soviet invasion in their country, flooded the black market. "Some people - especially the big shots - would pull a gun on my employees if they asked them not to smoke inside the restaurant," Raza remembers. "They felt insulted."
Back then, the brothers couldn't find a Pakistani company making sliced cheese. "One of my customers walked in with a packet of Kraft cheese slices he bought in America," Raza says. "He was used to eating a burger with cheese abroad and that's what he wanted."
Raza tracked down a small company that manufactured butter and desi cheese or paneer in Sahiwal, Punjab. "They tasted the Kraft cheese and then spent months trying to make it," he explains. Once the taste mimicked the yellow plastic-wrapped Kraft slices, the suppliers proudly brought a large block of cheese to the restaurant.
"I looked at it and I said, 'What is this?' You see, they didn't have a slicer for the cheese," Raza says, laughing. They imported a cheese slicer from the US and taught the supplier how to use it.
So who came to Mr Burger? "Everyone," Raza says.
In the first 15 years of business, Nawaz Sharif, the current prime minister, used to come for the chicken burgers, as did former President Zardari, who at the time was Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's fiance.
During the day, queues would spill out of the restaurant and on to the street.
"Everyone, no matter how important or rich they were, had to get in line," he says. Initially, the space was a great equaliser. High-ranking police officials and businessmen briefly rubbed shoulders with students and labourers at Mr Burger. But soon, there was a return to the well-worn grooves between these classes.
"We had space for only four hanging tables - no chairs - inside the restaurant, so we'd clean and wash down a space outside where people could sit," Raza says. "Some movie stars, rich people and celebrities who wanted to avoid the aam aadmi [common man] began to come in after 10pm and would sit on this cleaned floor to eat their burgers."
While the fast food concept was new for a majority of people, it thrilled others to finally have access to a beloved staple of life outside Pakistan.
"Members of foreign consulates and diplomatic missions in Karachi were so happy they could finally have a burger here," Raza recalls. His first sweet taste of success came from these customers. "You are the McDonald's of Pakistan," they would tell him.
By the mid-1980s, there were five Mr Burger outlets in Karachi. The tantalising brush with American culture that Mr Burger offered trickled past the palate and into other parts of customers' lives in a way that Raza had not anticipated.
"Customers began objecting that the teenagers who came to Mr Burger were behaving in a very 'Westernised' way - they would come there for dates," Raza says. "The kids are sitting too close together, they are holding hands," he recalls customers complaining.
For Raza, this was a source of pride. "I felt very happy that this was a safe space for these teenagers," he says.
"To this day I have customers coming in with their wives and they tell me, 'Our first date was at Mr Burger'. Their children call me Uncle Burger."
And these "Westernised" customers were given a name: burgers.
According to Raza, the phrase was coined by Pakistani comedian Umer Shareef back in the 1980s. "He saw that people of a certain class and from certain well-off neighbourhoods such as Clifton and Defence would come to Mr Burger a lot and he started calling them 'burgers'," Raza claims.
In an interview last year, Shareef confirmed the term was used to describe people from this "certain class", and he used the analogy of food to describe "burgers" as distinct from the aam aadmi.
"[In the 1980s] I started noticing women in restaurants who were the kind of people to pick up a roti using a tissue paper," he said.
"We had never done anything like that, so I asked myself, 'What class do these women belong to?'" It was a class that preferred to align itself with the West, and behaved as though it did not even know how to eat a common roti, he implied.
By 1995, the Raza brothers were flipping more than 100,000 burgers a month. A year later, they received word that they were being "watched".
"Some of our customers told us that they had been employed to thoroughly research Mr Burger, to see how it had done so well in Karachi," Raza claims. McDonald's was coming to town, and Mr Burger was no longer the only option for Pakistanis in search of fast food.
In 1993, Pizza Hut was the first foreign franchise to land in Pakistan, followed by KFC in 1997 and McDonald's a year later.
Today, KFC reportedly has the largest share - 37 percent - of the fast-food market in the country, followed by McDonald's at 26 percent, while other foreign franchises have made inroads here too such as Hardees, with 6 percent of the market share.
For consumers under the age of 19, who accounts for 45 percent of Pakistan's population of more than 185 million, burgers have always been a part of life, whether by way of the small roadside kiosks or international brands.
In 2013, BIL Foods, the franchiser for Fatburger, predicted that demand for fast food will continue to grow and estimates a 30 percent increase in Pakistan by 2017.
Industry sources say that it is difficult to put a number on the market share for homegrown fast-food businesses, but they agree that it is swiftly growing to cater to the demand.
Shahvez Fazail, 33, for instance, founder of the online delivery service Food Genie, has signed on more than 60 burger chains in the last year, including Mr Burger, and of these, new local businesses outnumber the foreign entities.
One of Fazail's clients is Ali Raza, 38, owner of Burger Inc. Raza studied and worked in the US before returning to Karachi in 2004. He, like many fast-food restaurant owners in Karachi I spoke to, spent his formative years abroad where he got his first job. He believes that the local burger chain boom has arisen partly because of the lucrative growing demand, but also from a need to cater to consumers like himself - a generation that has been exposed to international fast food trends and franchises.
"Part of our personalities are very rooted in another culture," he explains. "Its not just those of us who have returned to Pakistan, though - everything is so accessible via the Internet and we travel so much now that we all want to be part of an international culture that we see so much of."
While those who have returned to Pakistan relish traditional food, they also crave American burgers, he says. That's where the local chains step in.
"The international brands are great, but they're all about convenience and volume," he explains. "They can nuke you a burger in three minutes, but I'll make it from scratch, with the freshest of ingredients and the best quality beef in the market."
Despite the friendship between Pakistan and the US being lukewarm at best over the past few years - a 2014 Pew Research Center poll found that 59 percent of Pakistanis view Americans unfavourably - our palate still takes its cues from the US.
Local burger chains try to offer the best of both worlds, bringing fresh, homegrown produce to a menu with a decidedly American flavour.
Naveed Savul, 47, the owner of Burger Lab, which he started nearly four years ago, also feels the local market is spurred on by food trends outside of Pakistan.
"We were very used to overly processed, synthetic-tasting fast food, but then we saw a change in the US and Europe - a return to organic, fresh cuts and locally sourced ingredients," he says.
In the years Burger Lab has been operating, Savul has noticed greater demand for "gourmet burgers" - burgers with blue or gouda cheese, for instance - which, costing more than Rs700 ($6.68) have become staples on restaurant and cafe menus, catering to customers with deep pockets. According to the consumer research firm Euromonitor International, the annual disposable income of Pakistanis increased by 23.1 percent between 2008 and 2013 and expenditure jumped by 24.5 percent.
"Unlike my generation, kids today have a lot of money and there's an entrenched culture of eating out or ordering in," says Raza of Burger Inc.
Since the day Mr Burger came to Pakistan, burgers - the food, the concept - have become harbingers of change.
"I feel so happy when I hear people using this term 'burgers'," Ashfaq Raza says, laughing. "It makes me think of Mr Burger. It reminds me of how people doubted us when we were starting out, but then called us pioneers, and began to follow us."
"The Pakistani market is very trend-oriented, but it's a small percentile of consumers who start these trends," says Savul, owner of Burger Lab. These consumers manage to spark something. "One definite reason for this demand for burgers is the idea that, 'The cool people are eating them'," Savul feels.
PTI and its supporters arguably hope to capitalise on the possibilities that such trendsetters offer, and perhaps redefine what it means to be a burger.
"I think that when they [critics] refer to us as 'burgers', they are talking about people who are from the educated class," says Arsalan Taj Ghumman, 30, the former president of the Karachi chapter of PTI's student wing, Insaf Students Federation.
"We have never been involved in corrupt politics, we aren't afraid to question what we are told and we don't believe that politics must be a game of fear and threats."
For Ghumman, it is a source of pride that the party was able to bring a generation of "burgers" into the fold.
"The most ignorant people are those who belong to the upper class in Pakistan," he says.
"They have been given every opportunity in life by God and they have everything that one could desire. It is very difficult to attract these kinds of people to political activism, and if PTI has done so, it is a big victory for the party."
When PTI's critics comment on the branded clothes that these party supporters wear, their income or accents, and use the word "burger" as a slur, Ghumman has a simple retort: "Would you call Mohammad Ali Jinnah a burger? He lived abroad, he was educated in London and he worked there, and he liked to dress a certain way. Can you call the founder of our country a 'burger'?"

The royal was incredibly proud when he found out 11 competitors from five nations who competed in the the 2014 or 2016 Invictus Games will once again represent their country later this month at the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games.
Taking to Twitter, Harry, the patron of the Invictus Games Foundation, shared his best wishes.
‚ÄúI remember watching these competitors at the 2014 and 2016 Invictus Games."
"And now they've been selected for the Rio Paralympic Games. I can't think of a better example of showing how important sport can be for recovery."
‚ÄúI know they'll compete with the same Invictus spirit that we saw in London and Orlando ‚Äì motivated not just by winning, but by pushing their bodies and minds to the absolute limit to prove to the world there is life beyond injury."
‚ÄúThey will lift everyone around them and whether you're watching in Rio or on TV around the world, they will inspire you. I'm incredibly proud of what they've achieved and will be cheering on every single competitor during the Games."
Prince Harry and Michelle Obama are proud Invictus supporters.
Addressing the 11 competitors directly, he added, ‚ÄúTo those Invictus Games competitors representing your five nations, all I have to say to you is what an incredible achievement ‚Äì well done for your selection.
"You have trained harder than ever, but the fight to the finish line won't be easy. You all know this better than anyone. Cherish this moment as you get to serve your country again.
"Absorb the applause and atmosphere for inspiring millions, but most importantly - have fun!"

"Young people with melanoma are relatively unusual, even in this relatively unusual disease. Most individuals are older. I myself have never had a patient with melanoma quite that young, nor can I say a melanoma that was quite so difficult to treat, as Joe."
"Keeping it under wraps, not telling friends...I can't imagine how difficult that had to be for him, because he had to have read the papers that said 'what's the matter with Joe Roth? Why did he have a day like this?' And how badly could he have wanted to say, 'you know what I'm going through? You know, I've got cancer. I may not live. I don't know what's going to happen to me.' But he never said that. He never looked for excuses."
"I think he was sideswiped by it coming back, but in true Joe Roth fashion, it's like a blindside blitz. He shook it off, stood up and went to the next play. He didn't blink."
"That disease is something where you've got to put up or shut up and declare yourself. Joe knew he was being tested and that he was being asked to fight a battle that maybe no one had ever fought the same way."
"He wasn‚Äôt feeling good at Christmas (1976), but he put on his running clothes and said, 'I want to go for a run and I want to just keep running and running.' What can you say? There‚Äôs nothing you can say."
I think we all know who are these two guitar players. Joe Morris has been one of the most intriguing guitar voices in improvised music for a while now. An original and always inspired musician I think he is one of the few who doesn‚Äôt play generic guitar music, having adapted precepts, concepts, and even phrases from musicians who play piano, saxophone, and other instruments.
Mary Halvorson is an avant-garde jazz guitarist from Brookline, Massachusetts. Even if she is often categorized as a jazz guitarist, her music includes elements of many other genres, such as flamenco, rock, noise, and psychedelia. I‚Äôve been waiting for this record for a long time. Being an admirer of both, I enjoyed the news of this record where I finally had the chance to listen to them both. I was not disappointed. Being two of the most innovative guitarists in circulation this album could not fail to represent a moment of exchange, innovation, deep interaction. The nine tracks that make up this cd are, in reality, nine moments of dialogue, exchange of ideas, interplay and pure creativity.
The thing that struck me the most was being able to listen to their styles, always so different, blend harmoniously in a set of free extended improvisation, tunes that run from just over two minutes in length, to past the ten minute mark. Both know each other very well. The result is perfect, a balanced mix of sounds, emotions and notes that seem to be born with a simple spontaneity. Traversing Orbits is a great record.

Thanks to oh so talented Zac Wolf Photography, we got to see beautiful wedding of Reilly + Rob. Reilly was one of the very last bride we worked with before leaving NYC for Lalaland so it's extremely special to see this wedding turn out so lovely! The bride is wearing our HB6285 wedding dress and her wedding took place this past summer at Thomson Island in Massachusetts.
Lila was among the last group of brides I had a pleasure of working with in NYC before the move back to LA. She wore our HB6285 dress and our tipped veil. And to see result of our encounter looking through beautiful pictures taken by Nicki at Denueva Photo warms my heart. Lila's loveliness is matched by her dashing new husband Aron. I wish these two couple lifetime of happiness.
Ionized water is filtered drinking water that has been ionized. Water Ionization separates the water molecules into base acidic and alkaline parts. This is done through electrolysis, which uses the naturally occurring electric charge found in minerals ions like magnesium and calcium. When water has become ionized, it can enhance the blood oxygen levels and act as a natural antioxidant that removes harmful and aging free radicals in your body.
A good Water Ionizer Machine can easily accomplish this for you. You will need water that hasn‚Äôt had the minerals removed, which means no Distilled Water (empty water) or Reverse Osmosis water, unless it has the natural minerals added back into the drinking water, which most newer units do now. The ionizer needs the minerals naturally present in water to supercharge it with electrical potential, and super hydrating water molecules. The health benefits are numerous!
These are not all the benefits, but the most common ones. I love using my water ionizer, the way it makes the water taste, as well as the benefits I get while exercising and experiencing optimum wellness personally. So, what is an Alkaline Water Ionizer Machine?
An Alkaline Water Ionizer Machine is the actual water purifier that takes ordinary tap water (or any other whole water source) and splits the water molecules into acid and alkaline (there are benefits of both types), adds electrical potential and makes the water molecule properly structured for maximum hydration and benefit to health.
Water Ionizers can be countertop units that sit near a sink faucet and have an input and output chambers. You can control the amount of alkalinity or acidity you desire. Extreme acidic or alkaline water is really good for cleaning. For drinking, cooking and rinsing, I use between 8.5 ‚Äì 9.5 pH, and save the acidic water that is also created for a good natural cleaning solution.
Portable Water Ionizers and Alkalizers make it easier to take your super water with you wherever you go. They are nowhere near as powerful as full countertop water ionizer units, but you can get one at a really good price. The Tygo Portable Water Ionizer by Tyent is a good inexpensive choice that improves the quality of you drinking water, gets rid of bad stuff that can make you sick, and adds the healthy stuff that makes you feel great and hydrated.
The best water ionizer machine right now is the Tyent line of alkaline water ionizers. I particularly like the ACE or MMP series, as it is the most powerful, with an anytime guarantee. The newest model is the ACE-11 Above Counter Water Ionizer. It got awarded 2016 Ionizer of the Year too! You can also get an under the counter model, if you want to preserve your counter space. It is the best health device you can ever own.
It‚Äôs probably the best thing you can do to improve your health and performance levels and make your life disease resistance too. Add in the longevity and anti-aging benefits, and I think you can see why I love these water ionizers so much. You can get $1,500 off for a limited time, and also get a free gift using the code: BigDeal, just visit: Tyent Ace Water Ionizers.
Cincinnati Police Chief James Craig has given notice he will not take the Ohio police certification test, which would be required for him to have police powers. This sounds bad to me. Why would he not just take the test? It's reportedly 200 questions. I don't know how hard of a test it is, but I would have presumed he could pass it quite easily. By him not wanting to take it leas me to assume it may be more difficult, thus his knowledge of Ohio laws may not be up to snuff, yet. That may be the reason for him not taking it. I'm just surprised this has become an issue for him to address at all. He should just take the test like every other police officer has to do. I understand he doesn't literally need police powers, but I think the Chief of police of Cincinnati should have the power to make an arrest if needed.
It make sense to me that it could be a potential morale boost, too.

Welcome to Barangaroo, Sydney's new landmark waterfront destination.
The transformation from a disused container terminal on the edge of Sydney's CBD into a spectacular 22-hectare waterfront precinct.
Barangaroo is a place to meet, work, live, eat and simply relax.
Roll into the Cutaway and join some of the best male and female skaters in Australia this April for a school holidays workshop.
We acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora nation as the First Peoples and Traditional Custodians of this land. We offer our respect to their Elders both past and present.
We acknowledge this place is named after Barangaroo, a leader of the Cammeraygal people and wife of Bennelong of the Wangal people, who played a significant role within her community and that of the early British colony.
Damage caused by contact with liquids is subject to potentially expensive reparation fees. Also, there are many cases where important data was not recoverable and thus lost. The following are some examples of problematic scenarios and how to handle them.
Water damage may be caused by the following.
Dropping the player into a washbasin, bathtub, toilet, water tank, etc.
NOTE: Thinner cloths, gasoline (benzene), or alcohol will damage the exterior finish of your player, therefore do not use those products.
Just a small amount of water may get into your player through tiny gaps. Repetition of extremely small amount of liquid contact caused by water drops or humidity inside the player will lead to internal components corrosion over time. Avoid using or leaving your player in an environment where temperature changes suddenly or a humid environment as much as you can.
Once the moisture gets into the body of your Walkman, the internal components may be corroded, or short-circuited. Also, the WM-PORT jack may be corroded, blue rust may appear as in the below image. In particular, if the moisture remains in the metal terminal part, it will cause the rust to appear and damage the player.
If you use a case, it is recommended to remove it and clean it up frequently. Dust collected between the case and the body of the player may retain humidity and cause damage.

It was a decent genealogy Sunday - did more than usual because there was no Chargers game or Padres game on TV.
* Read email, blogs and Twitter before getting cleaned up. Chronicling Jeremiah and Rosalie - Part 2 (written last night) posted before we went to church. Before we went to church, searched the treasure box for photos that need to be scanned, and took a three-inch stack out of the box.
* Home from church at 11:20 a.m., and joined the Scanfest in progress. Could never get the CoverItLive producer thing to work, so used Miriam's blog to enter my chat comments. Worked the scanner while chatting and finding YouTube videos of 50s-60s rock music, had a great time. Got about 100 photos scanned in 65 TIFF files (440 mb total) - need to separate them and crop them and name them appropriately. Scanfest was over at 2 p.m., but I scanned until 2:30.
* While in Scanfest chat, Best of the Genea-Blogs - January 24-30, 2010 posted (written last night, edited this morning).
* Edited my OASIS "Beginning Computer Genealogy" handout and presentation, and printed sufficient copies for the class which starts on Monday. Checked in on Facebook.
* Tami came, and we left at 4:45 p.m. to go to dinner at Rubio's. Michelle and Randy have had the grandgirls for two days, so they met us and we had an hour with Lolo and Audrey. They ate well, and were happy to see us. Tami took the girls home and we were home by 6:30 p.m. Watched some of the Pro Bowl game while Linda was on computer.
* Back online at 7:30 p.m., read everything, transferred data to two flash drives for the OASIS class. Wrote two posts for Monday, since I have to leave by 9 a.m. to the car dealer and then OASIS classroom. Wrote this post, and just realized I missed Desperate Housewives again. Drat.
Genealogy today was 7.0 hours - 0.5 hour doing email, 0.5 hour reading blogs, 0.5 hour on Twitter/Facebook, 2.0 hours writing blog posts, 2.5 hours on Scanfest, and 1.0 hour working on OASIS class stuff.
To say I have been more inspired than I am at this very moment in my life, would be a lie. I have never been in a room full of so many people that are determined to simply, get better. Everyone who came to this workshop had one goal ‚Äì to learn. I guess it‚Äôs easy to say you want to learn, however the way these people went about learning was so impressive. They not only bettered themselves, but took time to meet, help, and encourage all the other people they met that day. I am so happy to be a part oof this community.
It‚Äôs really hard to explain just how the workshop went. So luckily for you, and for me ‚Äì I had some of my friends ‚Äì Brandon and Jasmine join me ( and photograph it).
I did my first of what I know will be many more workshops this past weekend in San Diego. Well, I have done workshops before ‚Äì or rather I have taught people about Music Photography before. But this is the first time we straight up rented out a venue to ourselves. As you learn, you sometimes forget. And the things you forget can be really helpful to remember. So the best way for me to remember them ‚Äì is to teach them. I have gone back to my high school almost every year since I have graduated. My high school photography teacher has been a big contributor and mentor to me in my life, so it is always nice to go back and meet all of her students. Through that experience and a few others I have learned just how much I enjoy teaching.
Anyway the workshop was broken into two days. Intermediate and Advance. They had loosely the same schedule, however the content and goal that was taught each day was different. Each of them started with a two hour presentation, then we shifted to a venue for four hours, and then finished up in front of the screen for another hour and a half. The first day aimed at taking people who have been into music photography for awhile ‚Äì to the next level aka Concert Photography Level Up. The second day was geared on taking people who are well versed in concert photography already ‚Äì and giving them the tools and information to assist them with the task of getting on tour ‚Äì Becoming A Tour Photographer. This is a hard industry to navigate, and I want to help you. If you have any questions, want more info ‚Äì or want to be alerted when I come to your area.
Talk with the band ‚Äì Tanner of In Flames and Joey of The Used!
All in all it was a success. Thanks so much for everyone who came out. I look forward to doing this more and meeting more people.

The apocalypse is at the door of Alaska‚Äôs and America‚Äôs northernmost community. You can read about it on the internets.
Houses ‚Äúfloating inland for miles?‚Äù How exactly does that work? Are the houses in Barrow somehow different from the houses in the rest of the country that end up inundated by floods.
Do Barrow houses get up on their stilts and move crab-like across the tundra at high water, or are they like jack-up oil rigs? The houses are built to float and the owners only put the stilts down when they want to stop floating.
Jack-up houses would seem a natural for Alaska given all the fears about global warming and the rise of the oceans. If high water threatens your community, just prepare the house to set sail, ride away on the rising sea, and jack the house up wherever it stops.
A couple of people suggested a review of websites that feature Arctic construction.
There you will find that houses are not ‚Äúbuilt on stilts because of the impenetrability of permafrost‚Äù but built on pilings driven deep into the permafrost. The pilings for the new Public Heath Service Hospital in Nome, for instance, were ‚Äúdrilled 30 feet through permafrost and set in the bedrock,‚Äù according to an article in the 2007 ‚ÄúAlaska Contractor‚Äù magazine.
Pilings are driven or drilled into the permafrost to varying depths all across the Arctic these days. The practice appears to have started slightly before Alaska Statehood.
‚ÄúThere was no known widespread use of pile foundations in Arctic and subArctic Alaska prior to 1950,‚Äù according to a 1957 report written for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The military in Alaska began experimenting with wood, precast concrete, iron and other pilings in the early 1950s.
Water drilling, churn drilling, and power augering were all tried to create holes in permafrost (frozen ground) to allow piling placement.
It took about 4 minutes more to reach 16-feet.
Structures built atop pilings started to become an Arctic norm not long after these experiments. The Department of the Army in 1983 published a 269-page guide for building atop pilings. The manual called for buildings to be attached to the piles so that they would stay on the piles.
‚Äú‚Ä¶Researchers predict that by mid-century, the homes, schools and land around Barrow and its eight surrounding villages will be underwater,‚Äù the Post story says.
Sea levels could to rise 2 to 2.5 feet at most by 2050, according to the U.S. Global Change Research Program of the U.S. government. That could cause flooding in the Barrow area and put some land underwater, but not even the shortest homes or schools would be submerged.
Not to meniton that Barrow is about 15 feet above sea level at this time.
Barrow does, however, face legitimate climate-change threats as one of the few communities in the 49th state where temperatures have actually risen significantly in the last 50 years, according to the Alaska Climate Research Center at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
The PDO is an old phenomenon that describes the pooling of warm water in the Gulf of Alaska. That warm water influences the climate of the entire state. To date the PDO appears to have had a greater effect than climate change on most of Alaska with the exception of Barrow.
And in Barrow the problem isn‚Äôt so much warming as it is a seasonal shift. Winter now comes later to the North Slope than in the past. The late arrival means Barrow isn‚Äôt safely locked in ice by the time fall storms start raking across the 49th state.
And that, not the rising sea level, is what causes the real and immediate problem for Barrow.
‚ÄúThe dramatic decline in sea ice coverage in the autumn means that there is much more open water to the west and northwest of Barrow,‚Äù NOAA reports. ‚ÄúOn October 13-14, 2012, a strong storm, 500 miles northwest of Barrow, produced coastal flooding in low-lying parts of Barrow.
No houses went ‚Äúfloating inland for miles‚Äù in 2012, but some old timers in Barrow said there might have been some structures moved inland a distance, if not miles, in a big storm that brought high water in ‚Äô63.
The report makes no claim to houses floating miles away, but as with much of what is reported in the media today, it could have happened. Maybe.
The Post article was written for an innumerate non-technical audience about a place they will never see. It‚Äôs on script so the audience nods and adds Barrow to the list of things they are deep passionate about saving. From what I can tell climate concern seems to be an urban affliction based on a notion the planet should remain in its present state forever. True students of nature who observe things know that nature and the planet are dynamic. Great blog, one of the best on the interwebs!
there is indeed a 3 degree increase over the last 60 years, but what it means is hard to say. as The Alaska Climate Research Center notes: ‚ÄúConsidering just a linear trend can mask some important variability characteristics in the time series. The figure at right shows clearly that this trend is non-linear: a linear trend might have been expected from the fairly steady observed increase of CO2 during this time period. The figure shows the temperature departure from the long-term mean (1949-2014) for all stations. It can be seen that there are large variations from year to year and the 5-year moving average demonstrates large increase in 1976. The period 1949 to 1975 was substantially colder than the period from 1977 to 2014, however since 1977 little additional warming has occurred in Alaska with the exception of Barrow and a few other locations. The stepwise shift appearing in the temperature data in 1976 corresponds to a phase shift of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation from a negative phase to a positive phase. Synoptic conditions with the positive phase tend to consist of increased southerly flow and warm air advection into Alaska during the winter, resulting in positive temperature anomalies.‚Äù one could, if one wanted to be cute with numbers, claim a 9 degree increase over the past 58 years from about 4 below the norm in 1955 to 5 above the norm in 2013. but that isn‚Äôt really how one tracks climate, a long-term phenomenon that operates on the scale of hundreds of years. we do appear to be experiencing a warming trend since the late 1970s. before that, we were experiencing a pretty awful cooling trend. if you were here then (i arrived in ‚Äô73 when half the winter in Fairbanks seemed to be 50 below), you‚Äôd take this over that. and it is interesting to note the regional variations across the state now. the state has been on something of climate plateau since 1977 with annual means for ‚Äô77-2015 increasing slightly in some places but falling in others. the average for that period is 0.3, not 3. how many people were worrying about global warming before ‚Äô77? i wasn‚Äôt. i probably started reporting on it in the late ‚Äô80s or early ‚Äô90s, and our temperatures have been pretty stable since then which is all out of wack with common perception and what one would expect with the global CO2 increase. but maybe we‚Äôre headed for a big spike. the last two years have been awfully warm.
actually, i mean internets. it‚Äôs the jargon of the day online where i met that French model. bon jour!
Sorry for the blog vacation ‚Äì I‚Äôve been working hard on presentations for Startonomics and the Virtual Goods Summit, which has taken a lot of creative juice over the last 2 weeks!
Anyway, I‚Äôm suffering some blogger‚Äôs block right now. I‚Äôd love some suggestions on areas and topics you guys want to hear about. Click here to suggest something, or write me at voodoo [at] gmail. I‚Äôll get back on the horse soon!
I am a Mendocino-based artist working primarily in acrylic paint and mixed media on canvas, and transfer processes on silk. What is hidden has always intrigued me: in the obscured underpainting, in the sylvan understory, in our subconscious. Much of my artmaking entails exploring these hidden realms of looking through layers and into the mystery.
I grew up in a family of makers. Recycled materials, race car parts, seagull bones, vintage kimono sleeves, and silk handkerchiefs have all imprinted on my artmaking since childhood. Some of the more linear forms of that collection find their way into my graphic design business, Tierra.
The vibrant and rugged Mendocino coastline is a constant source of inspiration, both in and out of the water. I‚Äôm a surfer, and there is an inherent correlation between the uncertainty, thrill, and vulnerability of surfing and the creative process for me.

(Vienna, 11 October 2018) Partners from Austria ‚Äì represented by Medical University of Vienna ‚Äì Germany, France and the Netherlands are taking part in the EU "MOON" project (multimodal optical diagnostics for age-related diseases of the eye and central nervous system) to develop new techniques for early diagnosis of these diseases and successfully apply them in treatment and diagnosis. Around 18 months after the start of "MOON", researchers are confident that, in future, it will be possible to use an "eye scan" to diagnose diseases such as Alzheimer's or to detect aggressive forms of age-related macular degeneration at an early stage ‚Äì based on structural and molecular tissue changes on the retina.
"The first concrete results from this project are not expected until the first quarter of 2019 but preliminary investigations are highly promising and suggest that we will be able to obtain high-resolution data about the structure of the retina in future and information about its molecular composition," says Rainer Leitgeb, Project Leader from the Center for Biomedical Physics at the Medical University of Vienna.
To achieve this, the research team are using a combination of several complementary optical techniques, which provide detailed information about the condition of the eye tissue: highly sensitive molecular Raman spectroscopy is combined with optical coherence tomography (OCT). In a matter of seconds, this produces high-resolution images from all layers of the retina ‚Äì including all the information about their molecular composition. Using this data, it will be possible, in future, to make a definitive diagnosis and detect neurodegenerative diseases at an early stage. "The earlier, the better the patient's chances are," emphasises Leitgeb. "It would be wrong to anticipate the results. But one thing is clear: it is possible to take a molecular look into the human eye."
And it is quicker and less invasive than ever before: "Neurodegenerative diseases not only damage the brain but also cause changes in the retina. With our technique, which operates with light, we no longer need to look into the brain. Our goal is for a patient to be able to sit in front of the equipment, have their eye scanned contact-free and be given a reliable diagnosis in only a few minutes," explains the MOON project leader from Vienna.
Experts estimate that the number of people worldwide affected by neurodegenerative diseases will double over the next 30 years, which would be a huge burden for the healthcare system. "However, if we can delay the onset of Alzheimer's by five years, this is not only a huge benefit to sufferers and their families but would also save resources on intensive treatment. Here we are talking about billions of euros. The focus of our research therefore mirrors the strategic direction of Horizon 2020: we are working on the solution to a huge societal challenge."
The European Union is funding the MOON joint project to the tune of around ‚Ç¨3.7 million over a four-year period as part of its Horizon 2020 programme. The project is an initiative of the Public Private Partnership (www.photonics21.org). Project partners are the Medical University of Vienna, Leibniz Institute for Photonic Technologies Jena (Leibniz-IPHT), TNO Optics Expertise Group Delft; Zeiss and HORIBA Scientific, as well as INNOLUME GmbH.
Sentinel-1B satellite is still finalising its commissioning phase, planned to be completed by mid September 2016.
However it was already regularly acquiring data over Italy when the earthquake of magnitude 6.2 occurred on 24 August 2016 over Central Italy.
Six Sentinel-1B Single Look Complex products for the passes just before (20 August 2016, 21 August 2016) and after (27 August 2016, 28 August 2016) the earthquake have been made available for download. These products are not yet fully operationally qualified and are made available as sample products to any Copernicus user in preparation for the operational opening of the S1B products after the satellite commissioning is completed. They allow in particular the 6-day S1A/S1B combined interferometric processing over the earthquake area. The corresponding Sentinel-1A products are nominally available as part of the routine Sentinel-1A operations.
With a bride of Russian heritage and a groom flying in directly from India the day before they wed, this is the ultimate international couple. And what's more, this adorable and oh-so-sweet couple's love truly transcends the test of time and distance. Having met 4 years ago while studying in Italy, they spent most of their relationship long distance with many trips in between. But after a proposal in India last year, and their recent knot-tying, he is finally moving to New York City for good!
And while this intimate marriage ceremony was already packed with so much love and beauty, they have a full wedding ceremony planned for family and friend's this coming September in Italy, with a celebratory reception in India to follow in December.
[NEW GADGET] With such extensive coverage from Engadget live blog to CNA on the telly, do you even need to read somemore facts/opinions/analysis?
Well, yes you do. No, I am kidding. Feel free not to read this. Oops. You just did.
Regardless of the situation, I just say this to satisfy my ego as a blogger. iPhone 4 is out! July looks like the month where iPhone 4 will flood the streets according to the national papers.
From a personal point of view, I think the battery life is going to be a big difference aside from all the features and hardware improvement. An improvement of with seven hours of 3G talk and 10 hours of WiFi data, vs. five hours of talk and nine hours of WiFi data on the 3GS. That could mean that iPhone 4 could last more than 1 day with regular usage. Meaning a couple of hours of surfing and smses.
More significantly, the 3GS is probably on par with high end Android phones in terms of battery life. But now iPhone 4 has raised the bar.

PC SHOW 2010: What to buy?
The state of our waters is a hot button topic. Water quality has become an election issue from Southland to Northland, from towns to nation, and it is often in the news. Swimming water quality and implications of the proposed Ruataniwha water storage and irrigation scheme in Hawke‚Äôs Bay are cases in point.
Sediment plume from Hinemaiaia Stream into Lake Taupo (D. Rowe).
What is at stake varies from place to place, but in general it is our health, wealth and well-being, which include industrial activity and the environment‚Äôs natural character and ecosystem services.
These high stakes are reflected in public surveys. In a 2010 report from Lincoln University, water pollution and other freshwater issues were identified as the most important environmental issues facing New Zealand. While respondents generally thought our waterways were at least in adequate condition, rivers and lakes ranked the worst. And in terms of meeting our ‚Äúclean, green‚Äù image, a 2013 report by Horizon Research found that addressing river and lake water quality topped the to-do list, followed by farm runoff and industrial discharges.
The ‚ÄòDirty Dairying‚Äô campaign mounted by Fish and Game NZ in 2002 no doubt help prime these opinions, while the catch phrase remains in use to this day. But land and freshwater practices are also changing. The campaign was followed a year later by the signing of the voluntary Dairying and Clean Streams Accord between Fonterra, regional councils, and the Ministries for the Environment and of Agriculture and Fisheries, which high-lighted a to-do list for farmers. The 2003 Accord was succeeded by the Sustainable Dairying Water Accord in August 2013, this time a mandatory agreement involving all dairy companies.
Given the nature of the debate, then, it is no surprise that the messages we receive via the media may be as muddied as the rivers or estuaries we‚Äôre trying to protect. Is the Manawatu River one of the dirtiest in the world? Are we ‚Äú100% Pure‚Äù?
The importance of these questions and the complexity of the science behind them led the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment to produce a report in 2012 on the main concerns of water quality ‚Äì pathogens, sediment and nutrients ‚Äì and why they are concerns. It was designed as a guide to the complex science for the public and freshwater professionals alike. But so much of the important science and management frameworks are out of reach from the public, even from many of the freshwater professionals ourselves, either because they don‚Äôt know where to look or don‚Äôt have the background to fully make sense of it.
What would be valuable, and somewhat lacking in New Zealand when it comes to freshwater issues, is a communication middle ground ‚Äì an open forum that fills the gulf between what we hear on the radio and what we hear at a conference. On the one hand this would benefit the public as more and more people engage in collaborative decision-making. On the other hand, freshwater professionals would also benefit as they make their research or policy planning more interdisciplinary.
What is the state of our freshwaters?
And what could or should we do about it?
Articles will range from measurement to management, with two or three articles published each week from October to December. So stay tuned, subscribe, and take part in the discussion.
I am not sure the PCE report explains ‚Äúwhy‚Äù well.
I believe ‚Äòwhy‚Äô requires us to put water quality in context. The PCE does this poorly IMO. eg What was our likely pre-settlement water quality and how do we now compare. The PCE contains plenty of anecdotal evidence but little numerical.
That is a very muddy, grey, unclear, issue.
We have one scientist lined up to talk about the use of models in general, and I‚Äôve specifically requested he mention OVERSEER, but there‚Äôs more to water quality modelling than this model so I didn‚Äôt want to exclude others.
Excited to read the commentary and wider discussion over the coming weeks. I‚Äôd be interested in the experts‚Äô take on the latest changes to the RMA(A) and how changes to notification thresholds might impact on community engagement and goodwill around freshwater management. Grateful we have the longitudinal study of environmental perception so we can track the effects on people‚Äôs perceptions, in light of a changed legislative regime for water infrastructure development.
Hi Robyn. Alas the RMA changes won‚Äôt feature much in this series. They would have been (and were) more fitting in Waiology‚Äôs previous series on water governance, though as the changes were only proposals at the time any discussion was limited. But you raise a good point ‚Äì perhaps next year I can gather a few articles on the implications of the changes for freshwater.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I think Overseer is a great learning/management tool. But as a compliance tool I simply view it as completely unsuitable. With a 30% variability I would challenge any environmental leader to convince me otherwise. The argument ‚Äúit‚Äôs the best we have‚Äù is clearly not acceptable. If you agree with me I would challenge you to make your voice heard. Without it in the near future we could be judging and punishing farmers with a blunt club.
Mike thanks very much for your link.
good to see this forum establishing. Check out the wainz.org.nz website that is an open data collection site that aims to show pics of fresh water pollution from around NZ. Th site together with phone apps and drone surveillance air craft have been developed by the school of science and computer engineering students at Victoria University in conjunction with the Wainz group.
I created diagonal fabric using strings of pinks, on foundation fabric cut 5" x 8" (used those "yucky" thin, cheap fabrics in my stash for foundation). After stringing the foundation, starched, ironed and trimmed to 4.5" x 7.5". Each of the string blocks will be framed by 1.5" strips, finished block 6.5" x 9.5" (including seam allowance).
The setting blocks are 6.5" x 9.5" of pink (yes, more pink). Using 2.5" green squares, stitch diagonally, clip excess, flip and iron.
Now off to make more string blocks.

Based in Santa Ana, CA, Unlimited Capital Group is a private lender offering loans in 15 states across the country. They offer loans for a variety of situations, including fix-and-flip loans, refinancing, bridge loans, loans for rental properties, commercial hard money loans, and new construction loans. They issue loan amounts ranging from $75,000 to $50,000,000 with a maximum LTV of 80% and terms up to 12 months. They make loans on various property types, including single family homes, multi-family units, apartment buildings, office units, retail spaces, hotels and motels, storage facilities, senior facilities, mixed use buildings, warehouses, industrial buildings, medical buildings, undeveloped land, and churches.
Below are the general loan guidelines published on the Unlimited Capital Group website. Please confirm all terms and rates directly with the lender.
The following loans are for education purposes only. They do not represent actual loans executed by Unlimited Capital Group.
Unlimited Capital Group issues a hard money loan to Terrence for a renovation project in Houston, TX, on a property that is listed for $280,000. Because the lender sets a 65% loan-to-value, Terrence will need to put 35% down so the principle amount of the note will be $182,000. The deal also consists of these features: 1) a 18 month term, 2) a 9% interest-only note, and 3) a one percent origination charge.
In accordance with the terms of the note, Terrence will have to pay a $1,820 origination fee in addition to 35% of the sales price, or $98,000, since there is a 65% LTV. After the deal closes, he will pay Unlimited Capital Group $1,365 in monthly interest payments, or 9% multiplied by $182,000 divided by 12 months in a year. If Terrence sells the project for $420,000 after 18 months, he would then realize a total profit of $113,610 after deducting the principle of $182,000, the cash contributed at the close of $98,000, the origination fee of $1,820, and the total interest payments of $24,570. This gross profit does not include renovation costs.

In my previous post - No second helpings, I revealed that I'm starting this new thing. It's not so new really - just new to me. New because, I'm just now doing it for the first time ever.
I did Weight Watchers online a few years ago and I had some success with that but it just didn't hold really. And then, last week on Wednesday I ate a big fat lovely piece of lasagna - three cheese lasagna and it was so fattening and good. And then, I ate a second piece. And then later that night I felt really gassy - to be honest, I did.
Then Thursday came, and I ate leftovers - another half serving of lasagna and then a wicked whipped cream butterscotch dessert. It was very wicked. I felt like eating that was a sin.
Then I started noticing that I eat a lot. I mean I snack all day long. I graze like a cow. I'm constantly in the kitchen every hour or so looking for something to eat. It finally hit me and I could no longer make excuses.
So Friday morning I woke up - and I must have thought about this in bed the night before because I was armed with rules - and then I just did it. I stuck to them.
And here I am going on day 5 of this thing - No second helpings, no snacking between meals - and I do end my lunch and dinner with a sweet thing - it's not a lot compared to before. Usually just a slice of toast with halvarine and honey or vla with a crumbled Speculaas.
Yes, even when we go on vacation to the U.S in a few months I want this down so that I don't end up gaining 10 pounds in two weeks. I think that's how much I gained last time... what with eating ice cream every night, soda pop with my meals, and so on and so on.
Well, I've decided not to give in - anymore... so far I am doing it. Because I believe in it and I believe in me!
Even today, when I was opening up a box of chocolate milk for the little ones, you know, usually I take a sip - just a taste... and I stopped myself from doing that.
Anyway, I got several very nice comments from readers and most of you are "strangers" - because we've never met in person and I was really touched by your enthusiasm. Thanks everyone. It's nice to have a cheering squad.
One comment, in particular, caught my attention. From Sonya. She says she does the same thing, and once a week she bakes. Wow. Once a week. I think I could add that to my rules. I might have to make an exception for birthdays - but I think I could do that.
Actually, once a week seems like a lot but I have many excuses/reasons to bake. Number one reason: FHE.
For those of you not familiar with FHE - this is Mormon lingo for Family Home Evening. This is where we spend one night a week - usually Monday evening as family night. We sing songs, have a lesson about Jesus or something gospel related, play a game, and eat a treat. Okay, not every Mormon family is the same. But most Mormon families eat a treat with FHE. So that's one excuse to bake in the week.
I have other reasons to bake.
Number two... ward calling. You see, I've been very comfortable just coasting along this last half year or so - just you know - taking care of a newborn requires personal attention... but now the Bishop asked that I teach Sunday School to the 14-16 year olds.
I have to admit that I was not prepared for the calling. And also, 14-16 year old boys intimidate me. I don't know why. I think maybe because I'm not around boys very much. And also, when I was 14-16 years old - they intimidated me back then, too.
Luckily, there are some nice girls in the class, too. Girls don't intimidate me - of any age.
I heard from the previous teacher, though, that all you have to do is bring a treat every other week and they love you.
So, I might be able to use that as an excuse as well. You think?
Number three... someone's coming to dinner - bake a nice dessert.
Number four... birthdays... hip hip hooray - or as we say in Dutch hieper de piep hoera!
So, I'm going to add Bake Once A Week to my repertoire - my rules! And we'll see how that goes.
Here is a picture of me from early part of 2010 - just because it's nice to have a photo in every post - even if it doesn't relate to the post.
p.s. I don't normally where that much make up... but I like this picture of me.
LOVE Weight Watcher's! you can eat like a normal person and you don't feel like you are going without.
Good luck to you..loved the picture you posted!
Well, when/if i hit plateau at some future point, then i may go back and do weight watchers, but for now... it's working! yeah!
Wow, you've definitely got a lot on your plate but you seem like a superwoman who can do it all.

Not for profits are being encouraged to nominate themselves for the 2019 Telstra Business Awards.
The team at MS Research won the NSW Telstra 2017 Business Award.
Now in its 27th year, the awards recognise Australia‚Äôs most innovative and entrepreneurial businesses across four categories: emerging and energised, small and succeeding, medium and making waves, and social change maker.
The social change maker category is for organisations that have positive social impact at ‚Äúthe core of their purpose‚Äù.
It is open to not-for-profit, social enterprise and profit-for-purpose organisations ‚Äì contributing a minimum of 10 per cent of their profits back to the cause.
Telstra business awards ambassador and acting group executive of Telstra consumer and small business, Michael Ackland, said business owners and NFPs should take a chance by nominating themselves for this year‚Äôs awards.
He said while 2018 was a record-breaking year for nominations overall, businesses nominating themselves dropped by nearly 20 per cent.
‚ÄúThis tells us that Australia has many incredible small and medium businesses worthy of attention and commendation, but some may need a bit of encouragement to seek the recognition they deserve,‚Äù Ackland said.
‚ÄúA successful business owner is a special breed with unique characteristics. They‚Äôre hungry. They‚Äôre creative. They‚Äôre bold. But at times, they‚Äôre also unsure.
As part of nominating, every entrant will receive a personalised in-depth business report with professional insights and advice to help guide future growth for the business or NFP.
Nominations for the awards are open until 7 March 2019.

My images are developed through an intuitive, playful process as I seek to reflect deep experiences of life's creative flow and brilliance in my work. Putting images down on paper, I spend time listening and responding to the evolving piece. I find the more open and curious I become, the more harmonic and unexpected the expression becomes. This expression comes from a profound and very alive place I feel is available to us all.
The feel, composition and meaning for each piece are built up through a layering of collage materials, mono printing and mark making. Collage papers are hand-painted, found, digital, mono-printed or stenciled. Some are very translucent and others opaque. Mono prints are printed directly on the base paper or on various kinds of papers applied later as collage. Marks and gestures are made with pencil, pen, marker, charcoal, pastel or paint directly onto the collage surface or onto the collage papers. Many times cut or ripped components from earlier pieces are brought in.
There is for me a love of the written word in the sense of the flow and visual language as in a poem rather than the details of a narrative. You‚Äôll see that rarely can the words written be understood but instead there is something about how language and image meet in a new expressive form.
I have also been bringing in natural, almost recognizable elements; a reflection of the natural world. These may be a whale‚Äôs fin; the sensual movement of a serpent‚Äôs form; the movement of the sea, teeming with life. This speaks to me of the wonder of creation, the power of life running through all our cells.

Freemasonry involves a number of fraternal societies. These organisations have their origins in the stonemasons which were important members of political and social life during the fifteenth century. Members can attain degrees of freemasonry at three distinct grades. These are apprentice, journeyman and master mason.
Each graded candidate is taught the mysterious symbols of the society and their various meanings. As they progress up the ranks their knowledge of the order also grows. This can take decades to complete. Initiations are important to the masons. They are a mixture of allegory and lecture.
The Blue Lodge or Craft are the main bodies that offer freemasonry degrees. Candidates can also attain additional ones which will depend on their location. Usually secondary degrees are awarded by separate mason organisations.
The base of operations for mason bodies are known as lodges. Each small lodge is usually supervised by a larger body called a grand lodge. These are regional rather than national bodies. In fact there is no worldwide superior lodge. Each one is independent and will not always recognise the legitimacy of other lodges. This makes the structure of freemasonry as a whole complicated and at times chaotic.
Modern day freemasonry has been split into two unique subsets. The first is regular freemasonry. Followers of this type state their belief in what they call a ‚ÄúSupreme Being‚Äù. Desp ite this they are forbidden from discussing religion while in the lodge. Additionally, politics is a taboo subject of discussion.
The second form is continental freemasonry. These are jurisdictions that have scrapped some of the more archaic rules. Free speech is encouraged and life within the lodge is more progressive.
Members meet at lodges on a regular basis in order to conduct their business. This includes organising charity events and electing new candidates. Sometimes they also perform different ceremonies and give lectures. Remembering the rich history of freemasonry is important for these organisations and so they use lectures to reflect on the past.
After these meetings have been concluded it is common for a formal dinner to take place. Toasts and singing can form a part of these meals. However, most of their rituals are focused on degree ceremonies.
They have unique ceremonies for each grading stage. During these the candidate is given secret passwords and handshakes which they are entrusted to keep out of public knowledge. There are different handshakes for each grade. There is also a special ceremony for installing the lodge‚Äôs officers and master. This is done on an annual basis.
Social gatherings are very important to masons. Their calendars keep them busy with regular meetings and formal engagements. Not all of these are ritualised. A fair amount of them are set in more relaxed environments. Philanthropy is a key aspect of freemasonry. Members strive to fund education programmes, disaster relief and different charities.

Overseas property can appear to be an attractive investment when it is being sold to you. This particularly applies if the property is in an exotic location and comes with the promise of high returns. After all, the returns in traditional ‚Äì and safer ‚Äì investments have been conservative over recent years.
It is not surprising, therefore, that many people invested in Salina Seas and similar overseas property opportunities. This includes people who invested all or part of their pension in a SIPP investment.
For various reasons, some of the people who invested in Salina Seas were mis-sold. If you suspect this applies in your case, you should get in touch with us.
Complete the form on this page to give us your contact number. We will then get an advisor with knowledge of Salina Seas to call you back. They will get an understanding of your circumstances and the nature of your investment before helping you make a claim.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) does not usually regulate overseas property investments. Salina Seas is a development on an island off the coast of Africa, so it falls into this category.
The fact the investment is not regulated or covered by the FCA compensation scheme immediately makes it a higher risk investment than standard opportunities.
To find out how we can help you recover money lost in a Salina Seas investment, please call us today on 0808 252 3696.
